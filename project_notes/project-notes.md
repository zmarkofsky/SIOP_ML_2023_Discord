- Interprets_information and involves_others have a minimum value of 2.0 in our data
  -  May lead to issues with training as there is no labeled data to indicate what the lowest value could be
-  Heavy skew towards the 3.0 value on most ratings except Interprets_information
-  Missing values for ratings are highly correlated, indicating that missing values may not be random
-  Text_exercise_final is actually a series of questions asking the subjects to further clarify their rationale of the questions they were given as well as a request to provide additional feedback
  -  This question may be highly relevant to our results but would require a large amount of feature engineering to become useful
-  Some text data
