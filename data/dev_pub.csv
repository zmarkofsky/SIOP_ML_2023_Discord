It seems that most innovative change is greeted by a certain amount of skepticism and resistance.

While I would like to be present at the meeting, I will be out of the office for the next two weeks. Due to the highly sensitive nature of this observation, I would suggest you set up a meeting at the earliest convenience.

In retrospect, I would have responded by importance (my supervisor first) down to the least important. I was amazed at how fast the 2 -1/2 hour went by. 2) There seems to be a trend of days with poor performance by the team leader of Trim Install. Everyday he substitutes production suffers.There has been a possiblebreach of securitybythe team leader. Absenteeism is an issue. 3) It seems to me that the team leader of Trim Install may be causing a lot of the problems in the section. Even if he is not guilty of theft of corporate property, his team suffers when he has to substitute for one of them. Though he complains about one woman's absenteeism, his is almost as bad. ----Original Message----- From: Assessment Administrator Sent: 4/5/2016 11:31 AM To: Pace, Jamie Cc: Subject : About your day (1 of 2)  This e-mail and the one that follows contain some final questions for you.

The three least important emails were the victory lunch, Kirkland plant transfers and suggestion box. 2) A possible security breach is critical and should be addressed as soon as possible.  The personel clash between the two workers should be addressed to prevent it from escalating into possible harrassment  charges.  The professional conduct issue is critical as it directly affects how a new customer perceives our company. There is a lot at   stake both monetarily and reputation. 3) Yes several of the emails at face value could have given you incomplete information to make a decision. J.J.Paxton's complaint  against a coworkers absenteeism, though valid, did not reflect his own absenteeism or how poorly performance suffered on  the days that he substituted.  Also, J.J. Paxton's turntable ideas may have something to do with his breach of company security.  There may be some valid information in job rotations and suggestion box for improving work performance anddecreasing  absenteeism by generating enthusiasm and minimizing boredom. ."

Here's what we need to do: Pull Debby aside and let her know the problems you're seeing with the work she's putting out, as specifically as possible. I'll set up a meeting to discuss her performance specifically when I get back. We need to make it clear that she's on thin ice, but that we're committed to improving her performance, not just moving her around the company.

I don't think I can let you cherry pick from the new people, it really wouldn't be fair to other departments. Do the best you can with training the new people we take on, even if that's slow going.

I'll be sitting down with Debby, one of the bigger absenteesim hitters, to discuss her performance when I return; we'll either improve her attendance or replace her if neccesary. Additionally, we should try to find out what Larry is doing so well so we can try to pass those skills on to the rest of the team.

I'd love to hear more about it when I get back, how about we meet up at 10AM on monday the 25th? Also, I'm glad you're getting involved with the data we're seeing from SEQUENCE, but you really need to keep that information inside the company; sharing them with your classmates and professor at this stage of the game was probably not the right move.

Did you handle each challenge in the order you received it, or did you handle them another way? Please describe your approach. I began by responding to messages in the order they arrived in, though some clearly required a more expedient response than others (e-mails regarding meetings/phone calls, accusation of theft), and so i tried to address those earlier than others.  2. Please list the major categories of issues or problems facing Final Assembly in the Bridgeport facility of Soundproof Solutions. In order of importance: a.)Adjusting to the newSEQUENCE protocalls b.) Team morale c.) inter-division communication d.) Misuse ofcompany data 3. Describe why each entry in Question 2 is an issue or problem.  The biggest challenge facing Jamie's division at this time is succesfully integrating SEQUENCE into the line. Its a change the company is pushing for and there seems to be an unreasonable level of resistance to the change. Jamie will need to focus on addressing the resistance and smoothing over the problems to the new system, which are not currently all being voiced constructively. Team morale seems to be a big problem to, though a lot of these problems seem derived from issues with SEQUENCE. For the most part, it seems like people are resistant to the change because they're concerned with the effectiveness of the changes rather than just laziness, which is a good thing. Once people see the positive results of the new changes, i suspect resistance will die down and morale will improve some. Select problem cases (Robin, Debby) may need to be addressed on an individual level to keep from poisoning the waters, so to speak. Jamie's department and Quinns department seem to have some bad blood between them, but it doesn't appear to be unresolveable, considering Jamie's new presence provides a chance for a fresh start. If Jamie can open up new lines of communication with Quinn, it seems like it won't be difficult to get their respective team members to follow suit. JJ's misuse of SEQUENCE data in his statistics class is a major breach in security on paper, but from everything available here it doesn't seem to be being used for anything illicit, and while it needs to stop and he needs to be corrected, it doesn't pose a serious threat to the company.

That being said, I do not think that you should share the results with both (breakdown) but recommend that you have individual feedback sessions about theirown individual scores. As forthe lunch, I do think that Pat should get it butshould announce that the results were close as this couldin a demotivation as well for J.J.

Getting buy-in from the staff is very important when implementation a new process and getting the management team involved in the role out might have alleviated many of the problems I faced today. 2-The leader from that group is very efficient technically but needs more ""managerial"" experience.

jNzQJgjOtEu,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Hi Tracy, I suggest you discuss this with Haley prior to you sharing this information with the team -Max Cary,  I am taking a statistics class in the evenings after work. Our instructor directed us to find some real-world data so that we can see how statistics affect our lives. I retrieved some data on customer satisfaction off of our server and brought it home to study. The results were very interesting, and at my last class, my instructor was so pleased that he had me present my findings to the class! I thought you would be interested in the data, too, since they are from our team. I looked at a random set of 10 scheduling calls during the past two weeks and then compared them to the overall customer satisfaction scores for each call. When I plotted them, the result was surprising. I discovered that lower call time resulted in higher satisfaction scores for scheduling! Look at the attached graph and tell me if it doesnt amaze you, too. In Week 1, average call time is lower, and satisfaction is higher; in Week 2, its the reverse.  I am going to share this information with Haley at next Wednesdays staff meeting. I think Haley will want to know about this so that we can integrate this approach into the way we manage. Unless you say otherwise, Ill send Haley the graph so she can see it before our meeting. Tomorrow morning I have called a meeting with the other Customer Support reps. At this meeting I will start pushing the other reps to handle their scheduling calls faster so we can start reaping the benefits right away.

YoLiXcwOIUo,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Hi Tracy, The statisctics class sounds very interesting and I am glad you are applying your skills to your role. Whilst you have taken great initiative in combining your study and work, there are a couple of issues we need to discuss as you have inadvertanly broken some company rules. Under no circumstances are we allowed to share our customersatisfaction scores with anyone outside the company. Whilst it may seen innocent in a course, you never know if other students from a competitor are also in that course! It is also compancy policy to keep this information internal. I understand you were acting on good merit however I would have preffered if you had discussed this with Barney, Hayley or Kim first. In regards to your insights, it is important to remember that there are several factors that create customer satisfaction, the length of the phone call being only of one them. We cannot say spending less time on the phone only will increase satisfaction - this will only lead to our bigger clients feeling we are trying to rush them! I would like you to cancel the meeting with the team tomorrow. Whilst I love individuals taking their own initiative, it would beideal if you sat with Kim first and discussed prior to setting up group meetings. Similarly, I would love you to share any interesting insights with Hayley in the future however it would be ideal if we discussed them first as in this situation you have somewhat crossed the boundaries and policies of the company. As I suggested, we always love individuals taking initiative, but in future it would be fantastic if you can run them past Kim or myself first to ensure you are on track. I would love to hear more about your course when I return and we can look at ways of using your new skills and knowledge in the company. Apologies for the detailed email - if you have any questions, please call me by end of business today. Regards Cary",NA,NA,"Hi Taylor, Fantastic work, always love a star pupil in ourteam! The initiative in swapping roles for a few days was great and I am sure Jerry recieved some great experience from this as well as progress in her skills. I have reviwed the survey along with some other notes left by Barney and think it might be better to hold off from asking Jerry to be your replacement. I know you have great faith in Jerry but I am concerned about a couple of the results: It seems she has not performed strongly in the areas of: Treating the team fairly Inspiring the team Making collaborative decisions Giving feedback and communicating with the entire team I am sure Jerry is fantastic at product knowledge and looking after her customers, but from a team perspective, I think we should perhaps work on her skills as a leader, and letting go of the 'sales' mentality to one more suited to leading a team. Its often the case that the best sales people unfortunately dont make the best transition into managing the team. Have a chat to Jerry, let her know we think she definately has the ability to be a star manager and is already a star sales person, but lets hold off from giving her too much authority at this stage. I look forward to working closely woth you and Jerry in bridging that skills gap when I return. In the interim, lets give the responsibility to Chris. he performed excellently as a team player in the recent ratings (A) and whilst he can work on his customer service, he is well liked and strong at working with others so will be ideal to look after the team. Any thoughts, issues, let me know Cary",Hi Alex Thank you for your insight. I will have a chat to the team and ensure they are careful and respectful of our customers at all times. I am concerned that we need to travel past break out areas to hold meetings as other sensitive information shared by collegues may be heard by clients. The break out area is for the team's relaxation and I dont want an environment where collegues cant chat to each other informally about issues or ideas. I will look for another area in the building away from the break out area when I return in two weeks however will chat to the teams in the interim to ensure they take care Regards Cary,"Hi Haley, Given Kim has been working with the team for several months, I would like her to make the call on who will recieve the full time opening. Looking at the results, every single team member has great results on productivity and similarly the results on performance are strong as well. Kim, despite Dallas's lower performance scores, I would like you to also consider his initiative in working closely with the instillations team in developing the flagging softwear as this also shows great promise. I am sure whoevere Kim chooses will definately be deserving of the role. Kim, can you kindly make the choice and let myself and Hayley know by the end of the day Cary",NA,NA,"Hi Hayley, I would like to nominate the following: 1. Quinn Labarre No training required. Quinn has scored very impressive A and B+ results in his recent customer service and teamwork surveys. He deserves the chance to move forward. Quinn was initially mentored by Jess Rollins and this has definately helped his progress thus far. 2. Jamie Dubrovuich Requires CS2LSIS training only Jamie has also performed excellently in his recent results with A and B results. Whilst he requires skilsl in the complex thirs course, he will be more than capable of learning all that is required. 3. Jess Rollins Jess requires ALL training courses to be completed. I am dissapointed that Jess has not had a chance for training despite being with the company for 4 years. I would like you to consider giving the team 4 credits on this occasion only as Jess has excellent potential. Jess has also mentored Quinn who has some of the highest scores in the team and she must be given due credit for this. I would rather not have Jamie miss out on the basis of credit points as both Jess and Jamie have the potential to be great coordinators down the track. If we cannot accomodate this request, we may swap Jess with Dallas who is also an excellent worker with strong results. Dallas requires stage 3 training also. I would rather focus on the full time workers first and give them the opportunity to progress thus Jamie, Jess and Quinn are the best equipped for the roles however if we cannot accomodate resources for the extra training, Dallas may fit this role. I feel quite strongly about supporting Jess in this move (without placing others as a result of limited training resources)and would happily discuss it further if required Cary",NA,NA,"Hi Taylor, Thank youfor taking the initiative on this. I would like you to have a chat to Sloan Lemanski immediately and remind him of his obligations to bullying other team members. Please make him aware of the serious issues he may face via HR in future and please monitor the teasing. I am surprised you havent discussed this with him in the past. In regards to Eluto, please stop the investigative work as this is not part of our responsibilities. As for Eluto, if she experiences any further bullying or harassment, and you are a witness, please speak to her manager Jody and Jody can handle this with HR. Please speak to Sloan as a matter of importance. Thank you Cary",NA,"Hi Taylor, Can you confirm what these guys are spending with us over 12 months? Are they small or large commercial? If small, we need Ashley to be sending these escalations to Kim and she sits in her team. Assuming they are large commercial: Lets not get ahead of ourselves and take it personally. They are a key client and we need them on board. Given they are looking after a wealthy group of clients, this may actually be legitimate ... In regards to the replacement roll requested today, please ensure they recieve it ASAP. Lets follow protocol on this one and ensure we meet our side of the after sales commitment. I would like you to set up a meeting with Tom in the next week and have a general discussion about the business. Please attain as much feedback as possible as to why we are always running into problems with only one roll per batch. I'll like you to go with an open mind and assure him we enjoy doing business with him and are simply looking at how to make our products less defective. I think this might open his mind a little and we may see a fall in returns. If we continue to consistently recieve one return in eeach order, I will evaluate the potential loss of business if we stop dealing with him alltogether. At this stage, one replacement order is not a massive loss to us, especially given the orders we recieve from him but we want to ensure others dont see this as a way to get free stock from us. Let me know how the meeting goes. Remember keep an open mind and great investigative work!! Regards Cary","Liang, Under no circumstances are you to escort any of my staff out of the building without a prior meeting with myself, Hayley and Human Resources. I understand you are protecting the companies policies however without discussing in detail whyTracy (or anyone else) has this information, you may not make these sorts of decisions. Furthermore, we work closely with all staff and have a system of dealing with these issues as they arise and walking someone out without a discussion is absolutely not part of this process. I am also dissapointed that you have removed something from a fellow staff member's property without permission. This can also be classed as theft with serious concequences. In future, I would like you to report any such issues to Kim or Taylor as a first point and then myself if needed and we can take it from there. I understand you were acting on good intentions however you may consider taking care in crossing the line. In regards to Tracy, I have already spoken to her in regards to this matter. Cary.","1.

Customer satisfaction insights: Tracy Hurdle reports research on customer satisfaction Alongside the security guards actions, this was important as an employee overstepped the mark in several instances:both using the information in an impropper use as well as organising meetings that could have far reaching implications on the team. The security guard's involvement further complictated the issue which wouldhave created a further disturbance in the office. quietPAPER ONE: A new product is faulty and will start to produce complaints in two weeks This created implications with the entire schedule of instillations needing to be altered as well as the issue of a major client being unhappy. It has a flow on affect on several issues including the fact this had to be prioritised over the new trial product.

I also initially passed over some of the emails that I thought were just informing me(ie. voicemail system)and moved on to the ones that I thought were more urgent to address. 2. The 2 largest issues are: Communication needs to improve by associates and team leaders.More buy in from everyoneinto the Sequence process. 3. Communication is an issue becauseit is effecting how team leaders interact with each other and their associates, which in turn negatively impacts productivity and qualtiy. Also, employees feel like they are not being completely informed on what is going on, whichnegatively impacts morale.Ifemployees do not buy in to the sequence process the facitly will not be able to takeproductivity and quality to the next level in order tobemore competitive and grow the business.

Let her review your findings, don't approach others in the company yet. It's too early to start changing our implementation. After Kim has done her review, we can then decide on our next course of action. Thanks, Cary",NA,NA,"Hi Slade: well done ! Yes, do ahead and have Jerry fill in for you. Be sure to designate a support person, in case he gets stuck. On another note, I will be sending Jess Rollins your way for some mentoring for a period of one month. A few customer complaints have come her way, and I feel you will be able to help her out. We'll talk later on the details. thanks, Cary",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Hi Slade: Please don't bother with handwriting analysis. What's important is to convey company wide that such actions won't be tolerated. Even if we find the culprit, this could happen again with someone else. Better to nip this in the bud now. Please inform HR about this issue. I would like to hear their thoughts on handling this. Cary",NA,"Taylor: I reviewed our residential replacment policy. It requires that replaced rolls get returned to us, so the replacement roll is not ""free"", as you suggested in your email. Are the rolls being returned to us, please verify. Have we been consistently enforcing our replacement policy ? As Mr. Weedler is ordering again soon, I want him reminded of our replacement policy. Please ensure this gets done ! If he requests a replacement again, advise him he will be charged if the ""defective"" roll is not returned as per policy. Let's see how he responds on this order. Cary",NA,"AA: 1. -professionalism of reps. Important because company reputation is on the line. A significant source of customer complaints. - installation execution. It seemscompany money is being wasted by re-work. Cuts into profit and company reputation damaged as well. -loose cannons in the company. Some seem to not realize chain of command. 2. Liang Chun - he tried to fireone of my people ! Simulation didn't say he was a security guard, I had no idea who thisguy was ! Security guard or not, he invaded privacy and seemed totake matters into his own hands, ignoring chain of command. Fletcher - important because I was the person directly responsiblefor ensuring his happiness and keeping his business. If hemoves to the competitor, it becomes MY fault. Weedler - this highlighted to me a misunderstanding or non-enforcement of company policy. Wewere to blame for Weedler taking advantage of us, the problem was internal but mistaken for an external problem.Another moneywaster. 3. promotion - I originally called Haley to say can't do today, need HR files. ThenI remembered Barney's notes on personnel. After re-discovering that, I was comfortable calling Haley again making a recommendation. I used the successful mentoring that Taylor did to help Jess improve her comm skills. I used Cheryl's ""entire team"" email to broadcast a message on office conduct. I know there were a few other items like this, but I'm running out of time as I type. Also I planned to email Arturo to deal with multiple installation problems, as highlighted in the email messages. I forgot to do that. 4. I felt I had enough (maybe too much) information. I didn't find myselfwishing I had extra information. My problem was wading through info I had, there wasn't enough time for me to digest it all.

dPAnYHSRVSY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Tracy, I would like to thank you on the fantastic data you collected on call times and customer satisfaction. I found the data to be very surprising and potentially beneficial to our company. However I would like to ask you to hold off on sharing this information with Haley and not to encourage other reps to have shorter customer calls. My reasons for this are because I do not want to change our customer service strategy based only on two weeks worth of data. I see your great discovery as an opportunity for further research on the subject, to see how effective shorter calls are on satisfaction. I thank you for you efforts and want to assure you that they will not be ignored. Cary Stevens, Customer Support Leader Central District",NA,NA,NA,"Marge, I received this email from Alex this morning and I just wanted to get you input on the situation being that you are in human resources. I figured a mass email would be called for and perhaps training for the employees. Let me know of any ideas that you may have regarding this issue. Thanks, Cary Stevens, Customer Support Leader Central District","Harley, This is the type of decision that I do not want to make based only on numbers. Is their any way I could get a recommendation on the candidates from whoever their supervisor is? The point of this is to find the person who would fit this organization best. I would not want to make a haste decision on people I have never even met. Thank you for informing me of the promotion opportunity but I do not think I am qualified to make that decision right now. May I suggest finding someone who is? Cary Stevens, Customer Support Leader Central District",NA,NA,"Kim and Taylor, I received the following email from Haley. Having only been here a day and not knowing our employees that well I do not think that I am qualified at this time to make this decision. So I am asking you to send a list of people to Haley today. I know the both of you know the employees very well and that you are both more qualified to make this decision than me. Thank you both for doing this. Cary Stevens, Customer Support Leader Central District",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Liang, Thank you for alerting me to this serious situation. First off I do not want you to escort Tracy out of the building today. We need to give her the chance to defend herself and we must explain the companies policy on such things. At the very least she must be reprimanded for doing this. I will alert Kim of the situation and she will handle it while I am away. Thank you again for telling me, I appreciate your timeliness on this issue. Cary Stevens, Customer Support Leader Central District","Professional conduct is important so our customers will be impressed and happy with using us for their sound proofing needs. encouraging employee empowerment (the stat data) but managing what they do with it. if Tracey started implementing a new call strategy then she could have harmed the company. her data was not sufficient enough but we do need to encourage her. providing service with a smile and being more sympathetic to a customers needs or issues. the theft email, the stat data email, and IT email. these were all important because if we can not even control and communicate exactly what is going on in our own organization then how are we ever going to help the customers. one problem was that some people were looking to me for answers that I did not have or was qualified to answer like the promotion or recommendations."

Please list the major categories of issues or problems facing Final Assembly in the Bridgeport facility of Soundproof Solutions. I think first and foremost they have a quality and cross training issue. Now that J.J. Paxton is getting Terminated or so it seems they will need to replace him and backfill another position. Based on the surface there might be a little morale issue that can be fixed with correct discipline that doesn't have to be harsh just consistent. I don't know if Paul spent enough time on the floor but Jamie needs to make his presence felt. The place needs to be 5s'd. They need to have refresher training on what they can and can't say or do when customers are walking the floor. Appropriate behavior modification is what I would call it.  3. Describe why each entry in Question 2 is an issue or problem. Quality is where customers either stay or they go. Morale is where you workers either stay or they go. Respect for Customers is where they either stay or go.  Supervisors doing there job is where they either stay or go.

The rationale is that he has done excellent job on both performance and productivity. I beleive performamce index is more important as it takes in to consideration how well someone has attended the customer call and if there are any customer complaints.

Cary Stevens Leader, Customer Support, Central District Soundproof Solutions",NA,NA,"Ok Taylor, I trust your judgment and you can go ahead with execute your request. But please bear in mind, the method in which you used to calculate the scores may not necessarily be the best measure. I think you need to separate the measure into two different components i.e. 1) areas where a higher score is desireable, and 2) areas where a lower score is desireable. I think this would provide a more accurate picture in order to determine a candidate's readiness for mobility purposes. This is true when you look at the three areas which correspond to number 2 above (as per your attachment) i.e.: 1) Makes decisions without others' input 2) Usually blames problems on people rather than the situation 3) Goes beyond limits of own authority Jerry scores high on the above three areas which mayreflect a negative team player attitude.

I will personally address this issue with my team, especially Sloan and Eden, on properand professional conduct especially during client visits. As an added assuarance, it may be a good idea for your team to inform me on future client visitsso that I can inform my team accordingly. Let's work together towards ensuring this doesn'thappen again. Thanks. Cary Stevens Leader, Customer Support, Central District Soundproof Solutions","Hi Haley, Thanks for the note, that is good news. In this regard, I would like to recommend Ashley Payne for the full-time position. Records have shown that Ashley is a stronger candidate with higher ratings in terms of customer service and teamwork. At the same time, Ashley seems to have a solid understanding of our processes and is able to further excel at work. The productivity scores also highlights the ability this candidate has that could potentially be trained and mentored to the rest in the team. Cary Stevens Leader, Customer Support, Central District Soundproof Solutions",NA,NA,"Hi Haley, Thanks for the note. I would like to nominate the following three people as candidate potential for Level 2: 1) Jamie Dubrovich - Jamie scored highest for customer service and works very well with the team. May be some potential to further groom into Level 2 role. Next step is to be nominated for training on CS2LSIS to further improve on weak areas, will utilise one training credit. 2) Jess Rollins - Jess has an excellent track record with the customersinprevious years. Loyal to the company and has mentor potential. Great at solving problems. So far have not taken up any training courses. Next step is to nominate for CS2BASIC and CS2LSIS training courses first, will utilise two training credits. This is assuming that my team will be allocated with more training credits moving forward so that I can allocate one more for Jess to complete her third and final training course. 3)Sandy Martin- Sandy is great with customers and excellent with the rest of the team. Track record shows projects normally accomplished in half the time of others. Very good with computers. So far has completed all training requirement. High potential to be in line for Level 2. Hope this covers the necessary. Thanks. Cary Stevens Leader, Customer Support, Central District Soundproof Solutions",NA,NA,"Taylor, Let me know what you uncover if any. Please schedule a time to meet with Jody Blanco.We'll inform that we're looking into this matter and there is no need for escalation to HR at this juncture. Pursuant to this, we will have a chat with Sloan to look into this matter more closely. Cary Stevens Leader, Customer Support, Central District Soundproof Solutions",NA,"Hi Taylor, Thanks for raising this issue. As this is standard company policy on returns let's just monitor this situation closely during the next sale as mentioned by Velma. At the same time, I will bring up this issue for discussion at the next Central District Task Force meeting happening on the 19th. A potential solution could be that if the customer requests formultiple replacements (maybe after the third request for replacement in separate orders) we will request for the customer to return the defective product to us at our cost. Keep up the good work and please keep me updated on this issue. Cary Stevens Leader, Customer Support, Central District Soundproof Solutions","Liang, Please do not execute this. Tracy has been taking night time classes on statistics and has been doing some analysis on how to further improve customer service. I would appreciate if we could meet and discuss this in detail first prior to you taking any action unilaterally. Seems like this may be a case of misunderstanding as I have the results of the statistics that tracy did some analysis on for his evening classes. I will be back in the office on the 19th, let's meet up then to discuss this further. Tracy is a hard worker and very capable, I would hate to lose a valuable candidate as he is over a potential misunderstanding. Thanks, hope to hear from you soon.

Cory Manning Final Assembly Manager , Jamie, Following is a letter from sales about some inappropriate behaviour exhibited by our group (specifically Trim install) during a recent tour with potential customers. We need to express to our team the importance of impressions when customers tour our facility. The customers are looking for assurance that they are getting a quality product and it is very inappropriate to ridicule one of our quality programs in front of a customer. Please conduct a team meetingby Thursday thisweekto address proper conduct in the workplace. Contact Karen in HR to see if she has some input or materials (employee guidelines) to use in your meeting. Since several were involved in these issues, but we only have a guess to those directly involved, I think it is appropriate to talk to the whole team about this incident and that it will not be tolerated in the future. The first comments do not look good because wedon't stand behind our programs, but the whistling and other commentsare very inappropriate and could be construed as harrassment.

The major steps in SmartChange include testing the solution and then implementing. Can we build a test unit before installing in the line? A weeks long installation seems like a long time. Does the benefit justify a week's downtime to install? I'd like to set up a meeting to discuss this project, but we need to answer these questions before ordering. Let's have the meeting when I return before ordering the unit. Thanks, Cory ,","Isaac, the schedule looks fine with a few clarifications. I will be out of the office until the 20th, so I will not be able to return reports to you on issues until that time. Also, do we need to have the final training before roll-out?

Quality - If we have quality issues, you lose customers and potential sales. In this case, it looks like we have quality issues that can be pointed back to certain individuals Engagement - this issue is very large- The confrontation between Larry and Emily and the concerns of Pat are very important because, right or wrong, it is their perception that they haven't had a voice in the current changes. What they are going through is common pushback or fear of change. Roll out of new programs - this is an issue because the rollout takes time and resources for training and communication for the project to be successfull Communication - every group needs to communicate their needs and understand and appreciate other areas needs for the new process to work Original Message----- From: Assessment Administrator Sent: 4/5/2016 1:46 PM To: Manning, Cory Cc: Subject : About your day (2 of 2)  Following are some of the e-mails that you received today, along with some questions about how you approached them.

There seems to be push back to change created largely from a lack of communicaiton, also look like there may not be enforcement of company procedures or standards and maybe a lack of leadership from Paul Bern. Communication is the Key to change and getting people to accept change,there also seemed to be people not working with peoples direct supervisor, seemed like everyone went right to the manager instead of following some sort of company plolicy or standard. (ie the removal of JJ would have only been one persons opinion and maybe not facts) The lack of leadership of Paul Bern seemed to manifest itself in alot of things being left undone maybe causing some infighting withing the groups or departments.Original Message----- From: Assessment Administrator Sent: 4/5/2016 1:45 PM To: Manning, Cory Cc: Subject : About your day (1 of 2) This e-mail and the one that follows contain some final questions for you.

The major issues in the final assembly area are 1. morale 2. attendance 3. lack of communication between managers 3.When the morale of the people is down, the team members are not enthusiastic about working and are a lot less reluctant to go above and beyond the call of duty. When attendance is out of control. It causes substitutions to be made and potentially puts people on jobs that they are alot less productive on. It also affects the team chemistry. Lack of communication between managers is not good because it creates an area vs. area type mentality that is not good for production. Then areas are not willing to work together and brings down the morale also.Original Message----- From: Assessment Administrator Sent: 4/5/2016 3:15 PM To: Pace, Jamie Cc: Subject : About your day (1 of 2)  This e-mail and the one that follows contain some final questions for you.

It is very important that we maintain our production schedule. We must find a way to meet our production schedule without any unnecessary delays and lost production. To accomplish this, I suggest we find a way to remove the existing software and install the new after production is completed on Friday 15th. I also suggest that we make sure that my group is properly trained on how to use the new software before it is installed. We need to establish who to contact if there is a problem during production, the week of April 18 thru 22. I will call you tomorrow morning at 8:00 AMto discuss these matters.My suggestion at this time that youtrain my team leads and myself for the trial. My suggestion for the changeover to the new software could occureither on second shift on Friday April 15th or on days, Saturday, April 16th. We must take every step to make any corrections to the program without stopping production during the week of April 25 thru 29.

The time crunch at the end meant some of the important items did not get the attention they deserved. 2. If the theft of corporate property turned out to be real then this is a major problem. Loss of company secrets means bad business. There are problems with qua;ity control as witnessed by the Droxy complaints. Poor quality will lead to less satisfied customers hency less repeat customers. There are minor personnel problems (moral & engagement). This leads to loss of production or inferior products being produced. Based upon the request of line people to support other projects, manufacturing will suffer. Loss of experienced personnel has already shown the line to suffer with more repair items.Original Message----- From: Assessment Administrator Sent: 4/5/2016 2:45 PM To: Manning, Cory Cc: Subject : About your day (1 of 2) This e-mail and the one that follows contain some final questions for you.

In these meetings, Al Howard wants to create an interactive, collaborative presentation where he shares his vision for the program yet also invites associates and their leaders to offer their ideas for improvement.  Before he left, Paul mentioned that some of the Final Assembly team members considered SEQUENCE just another corporate initiave that expects team members to move faster without any increase in pay or recognition.

Did you handle each challenge in the order you received it, or did you handle them another way? Please describe your approach. I answered the ones that were short answer and easier to take care of first then handled the bigger issues. I think it is difficult when you start with 10 emails waiting and 2 meetings right away. I wanted to get some of the tasks out of the way early and deal with the bigger issues after I had given them some thought, with the exception of the computer information theft issue. I jumped on that too early before I had read the email about the proposal. I am a big advocate of letting the lowest level of management handle their own problems as long as they are not huge issues.  2. Please list the major categories of issues or problems facing Final Assembly in the Bridgeport facility ofSoundproof Solutions. I think everyone is not on the same page as far as the Sequence program goes. There is a lot of people that are very sceptical about the program and think it will go away if they ignore it. It seems management did a poor job of relaying why and how the program would be implemented. Also there seems to be a lot of individualeffort and not a lot of teamwork. There are good ideas but implementing them mightbe troublesome.  3. Describe why each entry in Question 2 is an issue or problem.

Warranty claim was important because that involved a customer and eventually potential profit for the company.

We do not want to sacrifice a whole day of production if we can do the software push on a Saturday and not loose any production.

If there are any issues the first two days I will have Jamie Pace handle them and let you know what they are and he can catch me up to speed when I get back. I see that there is no training before the initial install, I see this as an issue. The team may have a lot of questions during the first week that are training related, I think we need training before the software is pushed and possibly bring in one of the software developers to address any urgent matters. I believe May 2nd is a Monday, I want the final installation to take place on the weekend as well as the initial install, and this will save us another day of loss production. If you have any questions or concerns, please get back to me as soon as possible. Thanks, Cory",NA,"Jamie & Al, I don't think that it is a good idea to celebrate one leaders success over the other.

I also left you a voicemail Thanks Jamie,"I tried to handle each challenge in order but i couldn't address them that way so i had to approach them by most important to me. I fill like some team building exercises need to be put in place for the workers and more quality control. The employees were not to high on the new system they were trying out and they were not getting along with supervision about the new ideas. Times are changing and people have to adapt to it. Also it seemed like some of the people work great together but not when other people are in charge so personnel issues needed to be resolved.Original Message----- From: Assessment Administrator Sent: 4/5/2016 12:31 PM To: Pace, Jamie Cc: Subject : About your day (1 of 2)  This e-mail and the one that follows contain some final questions for you.

Alex Norman has informed me that we have been having issues with our employees and their lack of professional behavior with visitors.  I need you to hold a meeting with all of your employees at some time during my absence. Email me when this meeting occurs.  In this meeting, address the following points:  *We have had issues recently with professional conduct, specifically with tour groups,  *The Bridgeport plant, specifically, is used as a ""show"" plant for tours. We cannot have any more of this.  *Anybody involved in an act of unprofessional behavior is subject to the infractions referenced in our code of conduct policy,  and, lastly,  *This is not a new expectation.

In response to any reasons to reschedule, I will contact Al as this seems to be a high priority of his.

There is a meeting that Al would like held (tentatively April 21st) that I will discuss holding on either the 15th or if the software install date is rescheduled (I will leave that change up to him. It might be better to hold this talk on a day when the lines are down.  For the crash course information, I would request you forward that information to the following team leaders: Jamie Pace, Sam Washington, Joy Sakamoto, Jesse Sanchez, Kerry Francis and Alex Fetisov.  Thank you for your time, I look forward to working with you.  Sincerely,   Cory Manning, Assembly Line Manager , Greetings team members,  I have just received information from IT on our new software rollout over the month of April.  As you see, it looks like Friday the 15th lines will be down for reprogramming.During that day I expect to have some information from Isaac for at least a ""crash course"" in the software changes they're implementing. I have appointed the team members to receive any information for this day prior to the official training dates (first week of May).  For those of you I have not met, I amPaul Bern's replacement, Cory. Today is my first day out of training.

Did you handle each challenge in the order you received it, or did you handle them another way? Please describe your approach.  -Due to the time I spent in the simulator, I realised that the first impression I had of an issue could be complicated by subsequent emails I read. I tried to summarize the points of each email on a list and then go throught them one-by-one until I had an idea of all of the issues I needed to address.  - As an example, I was able to delegate a responsibility to a worker (JJ) that freed up some time that a Team Leader would have to spend by recognizing that JJ would likely enjoy the task at hand. Had I waited even longer, I may have changed my mind once I realized that security would be taking up the majority of his time in the next few days! 2. Please list the major categories of issues or problems facing Final Assembly in the Bridgeport facility ofSoundproof Solutions. -Inability to thoroughlytest model 1's, leading to problems with both the higher end of range and the fabric covers - Lack of receipt of quality parts from Assembly on line 1 3. Describe why each entry in Question 2 is an issue or problem. Without being able to detect all of the faulty parts coming from Assembly, there were warranty issues looming and there was a second issue detected (faults on the highest range of sound) that were making it through Final Assembly. It is clear that with these issues continuing, even on only one assembly line's Final Assembly, we will lose customers and our reputation will suffer.

I did notice that we were asked to help with a modification for a Model 3 when our plant only creates model 1 and 2's. Honestly, there wasn't much that was helpful in the prework other than the layout of the plant and the background of the product and company. I noticed that I had much more communication with the boss (Al) than I would have with the boss here. I suppose that at first I was timid in approaching him, but once I realised how much we correspond I ended up CC ing him with most of my emails by the end of the day It would have been most helpful to have known my position prior to reading through the prework, as I probably could have mentally adjusted before I came in rather than in the middle of the day."
ulfpABDodol,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Hi Tracy, Those are very interresting results, perhaps we can leverage them for team improvement. The one thing I would coach you to be extremely cautious of is sharing any type of corporate information outside of Soundproof walls. I would encourage you to discuss any such sharing with our legal or HR team to make sure you are not in violation of any company policies. I approciate the work you are doing with your statistics class, but please refrain from sharing any additional corporate data with them until we can work this out. In addition, please do not forward the results to anyone internal until we can be sure there won't be any problems. Thanks for the update! Cary , Hi again Esther, I'm a little worried this information should not be shared with outside individuals. Would you please take a look at the email below and let me know how to proceed? Thanks in advance, Cary",NA,NA,"Great news Taylor!! Why not consider sending Jerry on the Pell sales call on the 20th? Perhaps you both could attend so you can both monitor and mentor his performance in the face of a client? Let me know. Cary ,","Alex, Thank you for the feedback, I will take care of it immediately. Regards, Cary ,","Haley, I beleive the candidate best suited for the position is Corey Thompson. While Corey does not top the charts in the performance index, he has a solid client satisfaction rating (B) and is very well appreciated by his fellow team member when it comes to teamwork (A+). I believe his straight forward and assertive nature can be leveraged to further develop other members on the team and that Corey will do a fantastic job. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to provide input into this decision! Cary ,",NA,NA,"Haley, The three representatives I would like to assign as candidates for level 2 are as follows: Quinn Labarre - All necessary training already completed - Quinn consistently ranks high in customer satisfaction and teamwork ratings. I beleive we should begin to push Quinn into more advanced work and give him the opportunity to grow. Jamie Dubrovich - CS2LSIS training needs to be completed - Jamie also scores consistently well in customer support and teamwork. I'm confident Jamie can pick up the technical detailed needed to be successful at level 2. Jamie is consistently recognized by both cleints and internal staff in a positive light. Jesse Rollins - Requires all three training classes: CS2BASIC,CS2IM,CS2LSIS. Jesse is fantastic when it comes to solving problems and getting on top of support calls. I think the lack of formal training has been somewhat of an impedance to Jesse and that a foundation in the Soundproof product set and capabilities will position Jesse for success on the Level 2 team. Thanks, Cary ,",NA,NA,"Taylor, I appreciate your efforts to find the individual or indivisuals responsible, but I think this is something best handled by HR. Lets let our HR and legal folks get in front of this before it escalates into something bigger than you or I can handle. Please take the HR route to get this taken care of ASAP, they are best suited to assess and act on it. Thanks! Cary , Good Morning Esther, Please take a look at the email message below. I'd like your advice and support on how best to handle this situation. Thank you, Cary",NA,"Hi Taylor, Weedler is a fairly large customer and obviously has a strong customer base of wealthy clients. Let's get in front of this next order by offering Weedler to send out a representative to assure everything is going smoothly with both the bidding process and installation. This way we can assure the sizing has been properly assessed and also that the product quality is in check. Doing so will show that we are genuinely interrested in his business and also help us to better understand his perspective.

Your answers to these questions will help in the evaluation of your performance by providing a better understanding of your approach and rationale. It is important that you provide complete and thorough answers to the questions below.  For your reference, a list of messages you received today is shown after question 4.  1. Please list the major categories of issues or problems facing Customer Service Team 5 of Soundproof Solutions. Why is each an issue or a problem? Customer satisfaction - My teams primary job is to assure client satisfaction. Any level of disatisfaction has a direct correlation to both my team and my company. The perception Veterans Memorial Hostpital painted of my team was less than flattering. We have to assure satisfaction. It would also seem there are additional problems with the installation teams when they are unable to perform a task as necessary as cleaning up after their own mess. HR issues - It is my responsibility to raise any potential risk to the well being of the company to HR as soon as possible. At least 2 scenarios presented risk to the overall health of Soundproof Solutions. One of the two also could cause significant damaged to our reputation. Internal Problems - The issue regarding Cyd and his installer Duncan could have several very negative outcomes. It appears there is suspicion within the organization the Cyd is dealing in bad business. Along the same line, at least one installer is also implicated. The could be a mass of client satisfaction issues and my team and company have no way to justify the costs due to a serious break down in process. There are also internal business/technical issues which are helping to foster the poor control processes in place. Product Quality - Soundproof Solutions pride themselves on their innovation, flexibility and quality. Without all 3 in tact, they will no longer be able to command a premium price for their products. Team conduct - There is no excuse for the situation that occured in front of our sales team and clients. My team must be exhibit professionalism at all times. 2. What were the three most important messages you considered the highest priorities to handle? Why? Veterans Memorial Hospital client sat issue due to the possible reputation and financial penalties Installation problems and potential improper upcharging of customers (ref: Superior Bottling). There is something much larger going on here. I believe a breakdown in the process has opened up an opportunity to inappropriate behavior. Fletcher Systems is a major client. We cannot afford to make this situation any worse than it has already become. 3. List specific examples (if any) of instances where you detected a relationship between two of the messages you received in your inbox. For example, when you decided how respond to one message, did you consider information provided not only in that message, but in other message(s)?

Describe what additional information you would have liked to have in order to have a better or clearer understanding of the messages and challenges presented to you today. Knowing my team better, I didn't like having to rely on evaluations performed by others or metrics I had nothing to do with setting up Understanding the product pricing and capabilities. I would have liked to control my own calendar, it was rather complicated sending messages for my calendar updates without being able to view it real time. A better understanding of the field schedules and my authority to authorize field work to aid customer satisfaction  The messages you received today included:  Weedler Contracting: A customer is suspected of abusing the companys replacement policies  Eluto Caplanu: Someone has placed an insulting message on Elutos lunch  Effective mentoring pays dividends: Taylor mentored Jerry Winters and presents the results  Customer satisfaction insights: Tracy Hurdle reports research on customer satisfaction  Promotion: There is new room in the budget to promote a part-time employee to full-time  Professional conduct: A salesperson complains that representatives behave unprofessionally  Theft of company-confidential information: A security guard suspects an associate of improper activity  Bench strength: Representatives must be signed up for training per company policy  quietPAPER ONE: A new product is faulty and will start to produce complaints in two weeks  Paperless office: A plan is presented to replace paper files  Installation in Sales: Sales requests scheduling soundproofing for their area, and a meeting with a customer  Feedback process: Kim proposes a way to efficiently deal with customer feedback  Fletcher Systems: An unhappy customer demands reinstallation and a meeting"
YiqIDoyMBrB,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Tracy - It is great that you are taking a class outside of work in order to continue your learning. I do want to talk to you further about this information. While this is great information to have and reveiw, it might be a little premature to jump to the conclusions that you are forming around call time and satisfaction scores. There are a lot of other factors that play into customer satisfaction scores. We also have to be very careful not to rush our customers through their calls, but instead listen fully to what they have to say. But I would really like to have you review your research with me in more depth so I can better understand. Would it be alright with you if we set up some time to review before you share with Haley and the broader team. Sine I will be out of the office for the next 2 weeks, would you be available on Monday the 18th when I get back to talk? If that works for you, please let Cheryl Constantino know so she can put something on our calendars. Once we have discussed, we can determine the best way to share with everyone else. Thank you. Cary ,",NA,NA,"Taylor - I think it is wondeful that you are mentoring others on your team that might be interested in moving to a higher position. If he is really interested in moving to that next level up, I would be alright having him cover for you while you are on vacation, but before a more permanent move is discussed, we will need to look into a development plan to improve some of his competencies. Although his average is higher than ideal, there are a few scores on the performance rating that need to be much higher to be sucessful inthatrole. For example, coaching is a very important part of the role. There are 3 main areas on the perfomance chart that are around coaching where Jerry needs quite a bit of improvement: Treats everyone on the team fairly, Inspires everyone to do their best, and Models effective communication. You knowwhat hard work it takes since you are doing really well in the role. Also - for the rating to be even, they all need to be ""positively"" stated, and there is one in there that is the opposite: Makes decisions without others input. Let's discuss further when I return from vacation so we can put together a more developed plan for his growth. Thanks, Cary ,",NA,"Haley - I would like to promote Ashley Payne. While Blaine is strong on the performance index and Eden is strong on the productivity index, I also wanted to compare all of the part time reps with the customer service ratings and teamwork ratings from Barney's files.Ashley is the most even across the board, and is the highest of the part time representaives in the customer service area and second highest in the productivity area. Customer service is a main focus for our team, so it is good to reward that. And a well rounded team member is good for the rest of the group to learn from. Please let me know if you have questions around this suggestion. Thank you, Kelly ,",NA,NA,"Haley - I would like to nominate the following 3 representatives to move up to Level 2: Quinn Labarre - Quinn isa strong member of the team. He has completed his 3 courses to qualify and is high in both the team's customer service and teamwork ratings. Jamie Dubrovih - Jamie is a well liked member of the team. He has only completed 2 courses, but I would like to sign him up for the third. He is also high in both the team's customer service (the highest rated) and teamwork ratings. Chandan Kumar - Chandan has completed 2 of his courses, but I would lie to sign him up for the third. He is one of the highest rated in our teamwork ratings and is a very enthusiastic worker. He is also good with technical problems and that might be beneficial fo the Level 2 representatives to have as part of the team. Thanks, Cary ,",NA,NA,"Taylor - Thank you for bringing this to my attention. I think it is best for me to speak with Eluto separately before we take any additional action on this. I definately don't want Eluto to be insulted, but we need more information around who before we can take action. I can take it from here, but I appreciate the work you have put in to keep this issue moving forward. Thank you, Cary , Eluto - My team mentioned to me that you recently had a picture drawn on your lunch bag that might have been insulting to you. I am sorry to hear that and hope that no members of my team were involved in the incident. I don't know if you know who did this, or if you want any action taken in repsonse, but if you do I would like to talk to you further in person or over the phone to see what we can do to resolve this issue. Unfortuntely, I don't just want to go by word of mouth around who was involved, so unless I hear otherwise from you, I will not take any further action. Cary",NA,"Taylor - I agree with you that it seems a little suspicious that he has ordered a replacement roll 8 out of 9 times. However, we have to be careful not to anger Mr. Weedler since he is a consistent, large customer of ours. In this case, it is a litte unfortunate that our policy states that we can provide one replacement item at no charge butthat is the policy and we need to follow it in all cases. In order to try and avoid this in the future, maybe we can try and work closer with Mr. Weedler to possibly hand select the roles of quitePAPER that he is recieving before each job. That way he reviwes the color ahead of time and can't call back to complain. And we can market it as a benefit to only our best customers. Let me know your thoughts. Thanks, Cary ,","Liang, Thank you for bringing this to my attention. I would appreciate if you took no further action on this and let me take it from here since Tracey is on my team. You might not have the whole picture of what is happening and I would like to find out the complete story before a severe action, such as termination, is even considered. I will be meeting with Tracey to discuss this. In the future, please bring these concerns diretly to me before taking actions into your own hands. And can I please request that you please respect your colleague and not take things that are their personal property. Thank you, Cary ,","I have added my comments under each question below.

It is important that you provide complete and thorough answers to the questions below.  For your reference, a list of messages you received today is shown after question 4.  1. Please list the major categories of issues or problems facing Customer Service Team 5 of Soundproof Solutions. Why is each an issue or a problem? Providing Acceptable Levels of Customer Service - The team's customer service ratings are all over the place, but the majority are in the ""acceptable"" range. Since customer service is a main value for the company and a main focus for this teams role, it should be much higher. It is a problem because it could continue to lead to unsatisfied customers which affects business. Respect - There were a few issues between this team and other teams that come down to respecting your colleagues. That respect leads to problems between one another and in the end levels of trust are affected and teamwork is hindered. The more the team respects others on their team and others in the company, the better the work environment will be for everyone. 2. What were the three most important messages you considered the highest priorities to handle? Why? Meeting with Cyd & Kendall- To make sure I was the best prepared for the meeting with Cyd/Kendall, I neded to review all of the input from my team and manager about the situation. Theft of company confidential information - It is important to make sure there isn't a bigger security issue going on that needs to be delt with immediately. It turned out to not be the case after seeing the communication from the team member. Fletcher Systems - Dealing with unhappy customes in a timely manner is important for this role. 3. List specific examples (if any) of instances where you detected a relationship between two of the messages you received in your inbox. For example, when you decided how respond to one message, did you consider information provided not only in that message, but in other message(s)? One specificexample is one I mentioned above. I read the email from my team member Tracey about herstatistics project before I read the email from Liang - which were related. Although theft is an important thing to consider, Liang's email didn't seem as pressing after knowing what Tracey was planning. I felt it was an important thing to talk to Tracey about in person to come to a resolution around. There were also several examplesof this around the installation calendar. I went back to Taylor multiple times to update based on meetings and new information from the sales installation email.  4. Describe what additional information you would have liked to have in order to have a better or clearer understanding of the messages and challenges presented to you today. More information about the representatives. SinceI haven't met any of them, all I had to work on were the team rating documents and personal notes from Barney (which I didn't know how much I could truct since it was personal input), and input from Haley. It is hard to make promotion recommendations without knowing more about their merits. For my meeting with Kendall, it would have been useful to know more about the available purchase methods and what those purchase experiences are like so I could speak more intelligently about them. Also possibly similar customer complaints and how those were handled so I could see if this was a commonoccurance or if this was a new request. The messages you received today included:  Weedler Contracting: A customer is suspected of abusing the companys replacement policies  Eluto Caplanu: Someone has placed an insulting message on Elutos lunch  Effective mentoring pays dividends: Taylor mentored Jerry Winters and presents the results  Customer satisfaction insights: Tracy Hurdle reports research on customer satisfaction  Promotion: There is new room in the budget to promote a part-time employee to full-time  Professional conduct: A salesperson complains that representatives behave unprofessionally  Theft of company-confidential information: A security guard suspects an associate of improper activity  Bench strength: Representatives must be signed up for training per company policy  quietPAPER ONE: A new product is faulty and will start to produce complaints in two weeks  Paperless office: A plan is presented to replace paper files  Installation in Sales: Sales requests scheduling soundproofing for their area, and a meeting with a customer  Feedback process: Kim proposes a way to efficiently deal with customer feedback  Fletcher Systems: An unhappy customer demands reinstallation and a meeting"

If Jamie does not address your concerns please contact me. Thanks, Cory Jamie, I received the email below from J.J. in which he addressed his concerns about Debby. These types of issues should be handled by you first. This is the first I am hearing about issues with Debby. Ensure that J.J. is documenting each problem with Debby. Every time she is late and every time she makes a mistake. We are not going to keep moving Debby to another team. You need to have a meeting with Debby and go over these trends and explain that they cant keep happening and her performance needs to improve. Give me an update on her performance when I get back from vacation. Regards, Cory","J.J., I dont have all the details yet about the workers that we are getting from the Kirkland plant. I can assure you though that each workers qualifications and skills will be assessed to determine if they will be a fit here. I will follow up with you after I have more details. Regards, Cory",NA,"Alex, Thank you for letting me know what Velma observed in the Trim Install area. This kind of behavior is unacceptable. I will ensure that it is corrected and Velma will not see this on her next visit. Regards, Cory Jamie, I received the email below from Alex Norman. I was shocked to hear about the behavior of some employees in the Trim Install area and the cleanliness of the area in general. Coach the individuals involved and let them know that this is unacceptable behavior. Also let everyone on the Trim Install line that the area has to be kept clean and neat. Follow up with me after you have addressed the issues I pointed out. Thanks, Dustin",NA,"Shea, Thank you for your insight on the fact that some of the Final Assembly team members considered SEQUENCE just another corporate initiave. As far as the SEQUENCETalk session, please contact Jamie Pace to determine what would be the best meeting time and location. After you and Jamie decide on the meeting time and location send me an email witht he time and location. I will contact Jamie to let her know to expect these question from you. Thank you, Dustin Shea, I should have ended my last email with ""Cory"" not ""Dustin"". Thanks, Cory Jamie, Shea needs to schedule the SEQUENCE Talk session. All the information is in the email below. I asked her to contact youand schedule a time and location that will work. You will need to determine the room that we will need to accommodate everyone from Group A, Line 1. After the time and place have been chosed, Shea is going to let me know. Thanks, Cory","Team, I want to draw your attention trend that I am seeing. For the month of March we have had several days with excessive repairs. Each of these days lines up with a day that some one was absent. Its not unusual for one or two people to be sick or absent on any given day. We find substitutions and carry on with production; however, its clear to me that when we have an absence errors go up. I understand that we all get sick and there will be times when we need to call off work. That is why we have sick days. It is important to understand that at these high levels of absences production is suffering. We need to reduce these repair levels and the absence days. Please, going forward, be more aware of the days your calling off of work and the effects it will have. Sincerely, Cory Jennifer, Thank you for drawing my attention to the repair trend and the increased absences. I will focus my attention on solving this problem. Regards, Cory",NA,"Jamie, Just received this email from J.J. It offers a pretty good explanitation of why he copied the info. Wether or not he should be bring the info home still needs looked into, but do not pursue any action to terminate J.J. Thanks, Cory","Isaac, You may go ahead per the schedule you included below. No changes need to be made. I will ensure my team leads are aware that I gave you the go ahead. Thanks, Cory You are all aware of our plan for the new robot programming software and all have had a meeting with Isaac Tecniov. This software will allow our team members will be able to make some adjustments to the robots directly, without involving Engineering or Maintenance. This will save both time and money. I gave Isaac the go ahead with the new software today. If you encounter any problems with the software let me know and I will inform Isaac. I will be on vacation until April 20th. If any problems occur on the start date of April 18th or the 19th leave me a message and I will address it first thing on the 20th. Below is the schedule: Friday April 15: Install the software. We will need a full day to install and configure the software. The installation is automated, and will be done over the networkno one will need to go to your plant. However, we will need to take the current system down while we do this. We will remove your existing software at this time as well, since we are replacing it. April 18-22: Your staff will use the software and report any issues to you. You will send the reports to me and I will act on them. April 25-29: We will make changes to the software to correct problems found by your team. May 2: We will officially roll out the new software for your team to use. Week of May 2-6: We will train your team on using the software now that it is complete. Sincerely, Cory",NA,NA,NA,"Vic, Hold off on escorting J.J. from the building. I do not know the policy on taking company information home to work on. This needs to be investigated more before we just terminate J.J. This truly could be theft by J.J. in which I would agree with the actions you recommended, but it also could be a misunderstanding. J.J. could have copied the info to just work on at home. I am going to have Jamie Pace contact you and get more information on the policies and what you observed J.J. doing. She will then determine if J.J. should be terminated. Thank you for your cooperation. Regards, Cory","1. For the most part I handled each challenge in the order I received it. If the problem did not need my immediate attention I moved on to one that did and then came back to the original issue. I did jump ahead to an issue that caught my eye as important. It was the email about the Theft. I thought that needed to be dealt with right away. 2.  Employee morale  Lack of belief in the SEQUENCE process  Product issues  Employee performance issues 3. Employee morale  This could be a contributing cause to the high levels of employees calling off work which in turn effects production. Lack of belief in the SEQUENCE process  if the employees dont believe in the process it is going to be very difficult to transition to the new process. Product issues  If the issues with Doxy are not addressed promptly, future sales could be at risk Employee performance issues  The way Jamie is currently managing her team does not seem to be the correct way. The low morale might have something to do with that.Original Message----- From: Assessment Administrator Sent: 4/5/2016 2:45 PM To: Manning, Cory Cc: Subject : About your day (1 of 2) This e-mail and the one that follows contain some final questions for you.

This type of behavior is unacceptable and bad for eveyone involved. As an employee we are all affected by this. Sales Department is using us as a showcase and we need to put our best foot forward. If sales suffer we all suffer! Please address this to the troops as a group. You may have noticed the names are X'ed out. That's because of a lack ofproperly identifing the people involved. We will never take action against an employee based on hearsay. Also there's a note on our general housekeeping. Keep the shops cleaned up, if you need more guidence in this area let me know.

If I had already started on one, I kept working on it until I was finished instead of looking at the new emails and potentially getting off track. I tried toreplytoemails in order of importance, but if I read one and could make a quick reply to resolve the issue or answer the question,I chose to do that. 2) It seems that the major issues are attendance and morale. Poor attendance is leading to lowered productivity and that is decreasing morale. 3) Poor attendance is causing people to have to fill in for the absent employee, keeping them from being able to do their normal jobs. This will directly correlate to decreased productivity and lowering the morale of the teams because they realize they're not being as successful as they could be.Original Message----- From: Assessment Administrator Sent: 4/5/2016 12:31 PM To: Pace, Jamie Cc: Subject : About your day (1 of 2)  This e-mail and the one that follows contain some final questions for you.

I've asked Jamie to look into Debby's performance to see if there is anything that we have/have not done yet to address the concerns you raise. If necessary, Jamie will coach Debby by next week Monday and we will review any progress when I return on the 21st. Please keep Jamiein the loop with any further issues/concerns you may have with Debby's performance. Thanks. Kevin Jamie - Do you have any info on productivityissues with Debby Britzki? Before moving anyone to another team, I'd like to find out if we have been coaching Debby to address any of the concerns that JJ mentions below. Has JJ talked to you about what he's been observing? Thanks. Kevin Good Morning Karen - JJ brings up some possible productivity issueswith Debby Britzki. Do you have any coaching sessions documented in Debby's personnel file? I do not intend tore-assign anyone at this point. Before making any final decisions, I'd like to seewhat we've done in the past to improve her performance . If necessary I'llwork with Jamie and JJ to develop a performance improvement plan to get Debby on the right track. I'll be out of the office April 6-20. If you can provide Debby's personnel file by the time I get back, I'd appreciate it. Thank you for your help. Kevin",JJ - I haven't heard anything regarding the Kirkland plant. Kevin,NA,Alex - Thanks forsending this to me. This type of behavior isnot acceptable and does notrepresentthe high standards of the Final Assembly Group. I will address this with the staff. Thanks Kevin,NA,"Shea - Please lock in the 12:00-1:00 time block with Al. Do you know what type of presentation Al will give? If he needs a projector & screen, please lock in the BP07 conference room. If Al just needs a flip chart, let's go ahead and conduct the meeting in the XR19 conference room. I'm interested in hearing some first hand feedback from the team - I appreciate the heads up. Thanks for your help.

Please let your teams know about this iimportant meeting and have them come prepared to offer their ideas for improvement. Thanks - We'll see you there! Kevin",Thanks for the report Jennifer. It looks to me that absences may not be the problem but rather ensuring the substitute is properly trainined to step in and continue with production. Can you ask Emily to take a closer look at JJ when he's filling in to see if that's where the productivity is slipping? Thanks. Kevin,NA,"JJ - Great work so far. I appreciate your commitment to the SEQUENCE process. Please hold up on placing the order for now. I think we definitely need to get Carson's input before moving forwardon the purchase. Let's give him until the 20th to provide us his feedback and we can make a final decision to purchase on the 21st when I return. I do not thinkwaiting will have a major impact on moving forward with this change but want to avoid any problems with the order if Engineering determines there are any design adjustments that need to be made. In the meantime, I will forward your e-mail to Carson to see if I can get his assitance. Please consolidate the data you mention and e-mail to Carson, Emily,and me. Plan on meeting on the 21st to discuss our next steps. Thanks for your hard work on this initiative. Kevin. Hello Carson - JJ Paxton, Trim Install Lead, has a great idea for improving our productivity in Final Assembly. He's done all the major footwork and we are lookingto move forward with purchasing the necessary equipment. Before we do, I'd liketo get your help to review the data he's been able to collect with Paul and Emily. I think you will find that there is definitely a benefit to his idea. Specifically, I'd liketo get yourhelp to ensure that the design of the turntable that JJ's proposingwill be the right fit on the production line. JJ will forward you all the data that has been collected. Can we get your feedback by the 20th? I plan on meeting with JJ when I return on the 21st and we will be making a final decision on the purchase. Thanks for your help. Kevin","Hello Isaac, I am confident that the team leaders provided you with the required feedback. You mentioned that it takes a full day to install the software. Are you planning to implement the software on only 1 assembly line or all 3? I assume that we will be totally shut down from a production stand point during this process. I am fine with your proposed timeline if the plan is to upgrade only 1 assembly on the 15th. If we will be upgrading all 3 lines, I would ask that you extend the installation to 3 days (1 day / assembly line), from April 13-15. I think the schedule for testing (April 18-22) as well as software changes (April 25-29) can remain the same. When we get to the roll out of the new software, again, I think we need to phase in the installation to all 3 assembly lines on 3 separate days so that we do not lose any productivity. Thanks for your help Isaac - I'm looking forward to the upgrades. Kevin Team - IT has developed software upgrades that will helpour productivity. The schedule for implementation is asfollows: April 15: Install Software April 18-22: Software implementation and feedback. Jesse - I will need you to complete the IT reports and forward them to Isaac until I return on the 21st. April 25-29: IT changes to software to correct any problems. May 2: Roll out of new software May 2-6: Team training on software The installation of the software on April 15 will require the system to be placed offf line. It will take a full day to install and configure the software. If all 3 lines will be upgraded to the new software, the installation will be conducted over 3 days instead of just 1 (April 15-18). Isaac will be contacting Jesse with the final schedule for install based on the # of lines being upgraded. Jesse - Please relay the info to the rest of the team. Thanks. Kevin",NA,"Jamie - This is a great example of leading your team to excellence. Both ofyourteam leads did an excellent job. I think this is an opportunity to improve on the job performance of your team that we spoke about earlier today. Before I give you my recommendation on who should be the winner...what do you think? Some other things to think about: Are you planning to continue this competition in the Group? If so, have you thought of other ways you can involve more team members to participate in the cross training? I noticed there are some areas that both team leads need some additional help with. Are you planning to coach/mentor them to continue their development? If so, how? You've created a great competitive spirit in the Group - Keep this going! Let's follow up when I get back to see what we can do to continue the competition as well asdevelop our team members. Thanks. Kevin **By the way, for this Victory Lunch, I recommend Pat as the winner. Another thing we'll need to discuss is how we evaluate the winners going forward? Maybe there are other competencies we want to evaluate? Al - Here are the results from the competition Jamie held in his Group. Pat will be awarded with the Victory on the 7th. Thanks for your support on this initiative. Kevin",NA,"Vic - Before you walk JJ out of the building, I need to get Karen's input on this. Have we allowed employees to ""take work home"" in the past? JJ has been working on a SMART Change project to improve productivity on the line. Some of his work has been completed at home.  Based on what I know, I'm not sure if this is worthy of a termination. Karen - Your thoughts?","Original Message----- From: Assessment Administrator Sent: 4/5/2016 4:00 PM To: Manning, Cory Cc: Subject : About your day (1 of 2) This e-mail and the one that follows contain some final questions for you. Your answers to these questions will help us evaluate your performance by giving us a better understanding of your approach to the challenges you faced. It is therefore very important that you provide complete and thorough answers to the questions below and on the e-mail that follows. To reply to the questions in these messages, simply click the Reply button above and enter your responses in the form of a reply e-mail. 1. Did you handle each challenge in the order you received it, or did you handle them another way? Please describe your approach. I tried to prioritize e-mails according to the difficulty of the answer required and the urgency of the response. Some of the e-mails required little research and a quick reply or forward to an interested party. Others required developing a plan and timeline and took a little longer to complete. There was one e-mail from Al Howard that required an urgent response. I missed the urgency the first time I read it but upon review quickly came up with a response and replied with an answer.  2. Please list the major categories of issues or problems facing Final Assembly in the Bridgeport facility ofSoundproof Solutions. Employee Satisfaction SEQUNCE implentation/training Quality assurance Leadership development/training Team building/cohesiveness  3. Describe why each entry in Question 2 is an issue or problem. Employee Satisfaction.Poor satisfaction scores can lead to productivity issues. Employees that donot support Company programs, policies, and procedures influence theCompany's ability to be successful with customers, profits, and safety. SEQUNCE implentation/training. Lack of training leads to poor employee satisfaction and can also lead to accidents. Poor communication during implementation of a project can lead to confusion, lack of support, and poor employee satisfaction. Explaining the ""why""will help employees understand the changes that occur and gain their buy-in to new programs. Quality assurance. Poor quality leads to poor customer service and a decrease inproductivity. It is important to identifythe cause ofany product failure to determine if it is a piece of equipment (""easy"" to fix by finding another vendor) or a process failure. A process failure may due to using the wrong process or, more seriously, a lack of training/focus by an individual. Leadership development/training. We depend on subordinate leaders to make decisions and react to situations every day and often times without any direct supervision. Failing to properly develop these leaders in how to make these decisions can lead to bigger problems in the future. For example, in the meeting with Jamie Pace today, he thought he was using good judgement by immediately stepping in to resolve problems his staff was having on the line. Not necesarily a wrong decision because his actions did not affect productivity. What he didn't see was that his actions were distancing him from his team. A better action would be to train his team to handle the problems so that he would not need to be the fixing everything. Team Building/Cohesiveness. There seems to be a lack of team attitude in the facility. No team work between Electronics and Final Assembly as well asbetween Quality Processes and Final Assembly. Therewere also indications of a lack of team work within the Final Assembly lines themselves. Lack of teamwork can lead to lost productivity (as evidenced by the line shut down yesterday).

xZKApboHgaj,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Alex, Thanks for the email regarding employee conduct. Because I do not have Velma's email address, I'm asking you to confirm with Velma how certain she was of the identities of the peoplenamed in your email. I need to be sure before specific action is taken of this intolerable behavior. Cory Alex, I'd appreciate if you'd contact me when you plan on dropping by with a customer. That would give us an opportunity to refresh the company standards with our associates. An email or voicemail would be fine. Cory Jamie, I have forwarded an email from the Sales Manager with details regarding various incidents that occurred last week. I have asked for confirmation of whether Velma is certain of which employees were involved. Please address behavior of associates on Group A, Line 1, by meeting with them today and reinforcing the company standards of maintaining a professional code of conduct. State how sexual harassment will not be tolerated. Thenext tour with Velma will be April 26 at 3:00 p.m. Meet again on that morning and discuss the company standards. If confirmation is received regarding inappropriate behavior of specific employees, we will act upon that information. Also, inspect the areas around Trim Install to see whether there is litter(e.g., bits of plastic and empty food wrappers). If so, clean the area and discuss housekeeping standards with the associates. Cory",NA,"Shea, Please schedule 2:00 p.m.  3:00 p.m. (during work hours) for this important talk. By having this during working hours, this will demonstrate the company commitment to SEQUENCE. The refreshments will also lighten up the atmosphere for some candid exchanges. Arrange for the meeting location to be BP07: 8 round tables, 36 chairs, projector, screen, flip chart.There are 31 people in Group A Line 1, including Jamie Pace and Emily Carson. This will allow everyone in the sections to have a seat. The projector and screen can be used for Al Howard to share his vision, and then opened up to a discussion section. With this being in the format of an interactivetalk, a flip chart to capture ideas will be needed. Cory",NA,NA,NA,"Isaac, Would it be possible to do the software installation over the coming weekend since it is an automated process? Also, how is testing performed post-installation? Who is involved, and how much time will it take? Can this be implemented on one line as a test case? Why is training conducted after the software is installed? We do not implement something new without proper training. I will be out of the office beginning 4/6 and will not return until 4/20. Jesse Sanchez will be the contact until I return. Cory Jesse, I would like you to oversee this new initiative that will benefit our production lines. I will be asking several questions regarding the implementation, but it is likely responses will not be received today. You will have to use your judgment and make decisions. From what I have heard, I know that you are fully capable of this. Consult with other managers as needed. Cory",NA,"Jamie, Yes, they both did well, but Pat is the winner because the average score is higher and several individual scores were greater than theideal leader scores. Congratulate both on their scores and emphasize the highlights in each category (e.g., Pat models effective communication and J.J. considers problems carefully before responding). Cory",NA,"Vic, Yes, I needed to know this. Who elso have you contacted? Themanager of HR needs to know. J.J. should be prohibited from working until this can be investigated further to make sure there is not a valid explanation. We will follow company guidelines.

osrvHnMWbWS,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,I spoke to Larry about his negative comments about SEQUENCE. I told him he needs to be open to change to help the company. We will take it day by day to see how his attitude changes,NA,"JJ, I need you to explain what exactly she is having problems with. I don't think moving her to another team will help her or our team. She just might need more training. Once you get back to me with what the issues are, we can discuss. Jamie","JJ, Keep in mind that these workers have put many years with the companywhich gives them a lot of valuable experience. They will be placed as needed. If they need to be trained, then I expect them to be trained by you. As the lead person of Trim, I expect you to be more positive and keep an open mind. Jamie",NA,"Alex, I have spoken to Larry and Harry about their comments. I explained to them that we need to maintain a professional presence on the work floor because we have visitors come through and the impression left on them is very important to the image of the company. We addressed the housekeeping by having the lead inspecting the areas before leaving for the day. Keith will get a written reprimand for the inappropriate behavior. He assured me that that will never hapen again. Thanks for bring this to my attention, Jamie",NA,"Room XR19 at lunchtime would be great! Thanks,","Jennifer, It looks to me that everytime JJ substituted for one of the absent team members, the errors increased greatly. As the lead of Trim, heneeds to know all jobs on that lineand be able to train people as well. I think this may be more of a attitude issue than a knowledge issue. I am going to talk to him soon so we can discuss how we can improve his performance. Thanks for the heads up,  Jaime",NA,"J.J. , This sounds like a great idea. It looks like you put a lot of thought into it. Before you order this turntable, I want to include some others in a meeting to present this idea to some ofthe other managers. I would like to get input from other departments such as Maintenance, Engineering, and of course Cory Manning to see if this can be implemented. Let's try to schedule a meeting after I return from vacation. Then we can finalize purchasing the turntable. I'll be sending a request shortly. Please prepare a presentation to show everyone how this idea will help our process. Nice work! Jamie",NA,NA,I think we need to re evaluate how we measure their performance.

Lack of training to operate under a new system. Even Team Leads did not have any follow on superviosry training 3.. 1. The Changes from old way to impletementation Sequence was done before anyone had a change to review it of prepare for the challenge of a new system.  2. People had issues with others and used the new system as a way of starting trouble or avoiding issues. Corrective behavior or documenting any problems where not taken.  3. Management did not see or act on the ""what if "" scenerio. Everytime a change comes about it must be addressed at all levels  4.This causes Team Leads to impose production at all cost and sometimes forgo the new Sequence system.

The new Sequence system was not impletemented correctly which has caused the falling of production and bickering amognst employees . Once this area of weakness can be identified then the fixes can be made for improvements.Once the changes are made sick time, employee bickering and traing would improve. When this happens production and quality will rise. 3. Several e-mails brought light to others but one in particular listed was the theft of company information. I later found out that the turntable proposal answered why this happen. This isa sad example of good emploees trying to make good of a system thatsuppose to identify problems and address them.

Please list the major categories of issues or problems facing Final Assembly in the Bridgeport facility ofSoundproof Solutions. Group A Line 1 had multiple issues which seemed to stem for the Group Lead being used to the way she had done things at her previous job.Though competent in her technical ability she had not yet learned to delegate or mentor. She was to quick to jump in and just do it herself.  1. Morale was low  2. Individuals on the team were not respectful of others or of the facility.  3. Many attitudes of distrusting the ""COMPANY"", us vs. them mindset. 3. Describe why each entry in Question 2 is an issue or problem. Morale accompanies high absenteeism, lack of respect does not foster teamwork and leads to low morale, supervision not supporting the overall corperate goals leads to lack of direction and lack of job satisfaction for the worker.

I will follow-up with Debby on these issues. -Jamie ,","Hi JJ - Unfortunately, we don't have any control over who we get. We'll just have to do the best job we can with the people that are assigned to us. Regardless, it will be good to have more hands on the floor, right! -Jamie ,",NA,"Thanks for this input, Alex. I will follow-up, especially with Keith's actions. Note that we have a birthday celebration for one of our employees at 2:30 on the 26th. We'll be done by 3:00. -Jamie , by the way, our work areas will be cleaned up for the corporate auditon the 20th I expect no problems on the 26th, but since I'll be in town then, I'll walk through myself and make sure things are presentable. Jamie",NA,"Hi Shea - let's shoot for noontime on the 21st. Lunchtime is a good time to get everyone together, and everyone likes free food! Please reserve BP07 for the meeting. I've got 31 in my group, and we'll need the table space and Al will probably want the projector. We'll want the flip chart for any interaction activities. thanks, Ed ,","Hi Jennifer - Thanks for the data. I agree with your observation that when Larry isn't on the line, errors go up. Certainly, that was the case on the 14th. The bigger trend I see, though, is that when JJ covers for any absent empolyee, errors go up. Even though he has the best intentions, I am concerned that something he is doing is causing the errors. I will dig into this more with JJ and will let you know what we find. -Jamie ,",NA,"Hi JJ - this seems like a great idea to me. I'm just concerned about ordering such a key part without Carson's OK. Let me give him a call today. If I don't hear back from him by the end of the day today, I'll give you approval to order the part. Please don't progress without that approval, though. There may be something we're missing. thanks, Jamie ,","Hi Issac - Thanks for keeping me in the loops on these plans. I have some significant concerns. On Friday the 15th, we run our Sequence report from 4:30-5:00. This is an important report; the network cannot be down at that time. Please do this on Thursday the 14th instead. That way, we'll have friday to debug if necessary. You don't propose training until May 2-6, weeks after the software has been installed and in-use on the floor. We can't go this long without training! Please schedule training before the install, sometime between 4/11-4/13. At least get our leads familiar with the software so they can teach the rest of the team. Please make the above changes to the plan. I'm out starting tomorrow, so if I don't hear back from you today, I'll assume all are acceptable. Jamie ,",NA,"Cory - here are the results of a cross-training exercise Paul performed before he left. Both Pat and JJ did a good job, but Pat's performance came out on top. Interestingly, they are strong in different areas. Pat is a better manager, while JJ is better on the technical side. This suggests areas in which they can both improve. While I would announce Pat as the winner, please go ahead and buy JJ lunch as well. They both did a fine job, and to Paul's point, this is a cheap way to motivate employees. thanks, Ed ,",NA,"No need to worry, Vic. JJ let me know in a previous email that he was doing some homework to research a new turntable design. It is OK with me. -Jamie ,","I usually work backwards in time, from the most recent emails to the oldest. Often there is newer info that is more pertinent than the older. Still, I make a point to look for relevant, older, information to make sure I don't miss anything. Major issues: 1. Participation with SEQUENCE system. Need to get experienced hands working on the system, need to provide team members with the opportunity to participiate with the system. 2. Interpersonal relationships. Need to make sure Final Assembly works well with upstream department. Define specs and agree upon working protocols to keep the line running smoothly. 3. Quality . Need to understand what drives defects and what we can implement in the line to reduce defects. 4. Productivity / absenteeism. We are missing productivity goals and experiencing high error rates because of absenteeism, which is in turn driven by low morale. We need to increase employee involvement (such as though the suggestion box and job rotation), increase job satisfaction (through participation in SEQUENCE), and improve personal relationships. With improved morale will come productivity. Participation with SEQUENCE is an issue. We need to work towards this. Interpersonal relationships are a problem that can be fixed with communication. Quality is a problem that can be fixed when we understand the root cause. Productivity / absenteeism is a problem that can be fixed when we improve morale (which is an issue)Original Message----- From: Assessment Administrator Sent: 4/5/2016 1:35 PM To: Pace, Jamie Cc: Subject : About your day (1 of 2)  This e-mail and the one that follows contain some final questions for you.

It seems to me that we would place the employess in certain areas based on their skillset. I appreciate that you want to start off with a strong team; however, i will decide how they get distributed into your group.

The team has fairly low moral . I have attached the score card that I received. There is a high percentage of responses in the 40% range. I have some ideas on how to solve the problems. I have spoken to the team leader and I am hopeful that I can improve the communication among the team. This problem will not be solved overnight; again, please be patient with me as I try to work on these issues. Thanks. Cory ,",NA,"Hi JJ, Iappreciate your hard work on this project. I do have some concerns that you are sharing proprietary information with your classmates. I believe that their understanding might be quite limited to the content of the information, so for now I would like you to stop all information exchange with them. We have many competitors in our market, so we can't allow confidential information to be taken. As far as the project itself, you must understand that the subject matter is quite new to me. I would like to slow down the pace of the project a little so that I can really understand what is involved.It appears to me thatthere can be some real benefits to the operation and we can improve productivity. Please do not call Barrett to place any orders. I would like to meet with you and Emily when I get back from my trip. I will be back on April 20th. Let's have a meeting in the afternoon on the 20th so we can go over the project. I would like you to prepare some presentation slides that would help bring me up to speed on the whole project.

I believe the priority would be through my manager, Al Howard. I do believe; however, that customer related concerns and employee disagreements rank high on my priority. 2. Please list the major categories of issues or problems facing Final Assembly in the Bridgeport facility ofSoundproof Solutions. There are communication problems with the SEQUENCE program. It appears to me that the benefits of the program are not understood by the employees. There are moral issues, some believe that the SEQUENCE program is another program that would require more work and there will be no reward. There are employees that have been there a long time that are very resistant to change. These employees are typically the ones that are not accepting of the new programs.  3. Describe why each entry in Question 2 is an issue or problem. The communication problem results in poor acceptance of the program. The program seemed be be brought in from the management. The employees feel that the program has no benefits. There was no communication from the employees back up the organization.The employees need to be considered. I suppose if their thoughts and ideas were considered when developing the program this would have resulted in employee ""buy-in"". The more seasoned employees are more resistant. It appears to me that the these employees should be used to develop a program. Their involvement would allow them to feel like they have a part in the program. This would allow the company to utilize their skills to the fullest, which would also benefit the process. I believe that the program could have been brought in from management, but also changed to adapt it to the existing process. At this point, the employees could take more ownership of the program and see it to a successful implementation.

Not sure what the issues are but when you have so many different people calling in sick...morale is down for a reason. The training issues I am looking at is in Security....with thinking they could just fire an employee, and no witnesses to varify what happened. Also, the Emily and Larry situation is a good example of lack of training. Emily in her position would gain much more insight to the way people take change and the reactions she may receive from them. Larry was out of line talking to anyone like that, but in the real world that was a perfect example of what we face at times. He was venting and needed to be heard.the over zealous employee is JJ, not sure where he is coming from or what the problem is. He may really love what he does and wants or needs recognition for that, or is a disgruntled employee using his position to hurt the company, if he indeed was stealing.

This is surly alarmed situation. We have total9 incideances where Trim install repairs have crossed the allowable counts. We have observed that the amplifiers received by the team are having fan bolt tighten very strong and trim install team needs to loose it and install fan and then again tight it. Due to strong titening, many times they have to stopped the lines and also have resulted in scrap or repairing. This is one of the reason identified. For this we have already informe Mel Chang to instruct the respective team members to take care. However to overcome such issues, we have proposed a change in the fitting process and that is to use the adhesive and scre fitting will be done by Trim team only. Mel Chang has to take decision. I request you as part of quality team also to evaluate this change. So we can implement at the earliest. JJ's absentism is observed for 8 times in March.

Is it from inhouse team or will be from external agencies. 5.Training is scheduled little late. We shall have it in parallel so my team can pick it up early and we can put production line in operation at the earliest. 6.

I will take this information to the trim install team and employ the SEQUENCE program to drive improvement in that groups quality. Based on this limited data, I can't agree that the reworks are higher when Larry is sick. There are only two data points with Larry being sick. On the 8th, the RW was only slight elevated. That leaves just the 14th which had very high reworks. There are many other days that Larry was on site and the RW's were still quite elevated (see 3, 4, 17, 18, 23 and 25). The more disturbing trend that I see is that all the days when JJ substituted for someone, the RW's were higher. This is a bit of a problem since JJ is our lead. But it warrants further investigation. Thanks, James , Hi JJ, I received this report about our trim install repairs in March. Do we keep records of trim install repairs by installer? If we don't have that data recorded, I want to you to look into how we can do that. The one troubling trend in this report is that the RW was much higher on the days that you were filling in for other team members. Please review this data and consider what the cause might be. We'll discuss when I'm back in the office. Thanks, Jamie\",NA,"Hi JJ, Sounds like you've done a lot of good work on this project and that it has the potential for some significant improvement. However, before we proceed with placing an order for the turntable, I'd like to see some more details. Let's schedule a meeting to review this project as soon as I return. During that session, I would like to see the cost justification for the turntable. We'll also have to establish a qual plan to ensure the new process flow doesn't reduce yield or quality. I'm also wondering if you have solicited input from the Trim Install team on this project? I think it's great that you took the initiative to review this project with your stats class. But my first reaction is that sharing our manufacturing data may not be in our best interest. Since I'm new to Soundproof Solutions, I'm not sure what our policy is on that. Let me do some digging and get back to you But for now, please refrain from sharing any more Soundproof manufacturing data with anyone outside the company. Thanks, Jamie ,","Isaac and Al, This sounds like an important update and project. But I have a few concerns we need to address before we continue. First, I will be out of the office until April 20. We cannot install the softwarewhile I am away. Second, you mention the training will be in May. How can my team test the software without training first. Please schedule the training to begin whil I am out of the office. That way we'll be making progress while I'm gone. Finally, I'm wondering if there is a way to pilot this software onjust a portion of the production line rather than the entire line. Thanks, Jamie ,",NA,"Hello Cory, I've reviewed the results of this questionnair. It's clear that Pat performed better on this report. However, I am concerned about the message we are sending by announcing a ""winner"". I think it'spossible that it may not have theeffect we wantit to. I suggest wereport the reults toeach group lead without showing the other individual's results. And provide them withsuggestion for what to keep doing and what to improve on. We could buy them both lunchtoreward them for engaging in this process. But if you want to stick with the original plan of avicotry lunch, then it would have to be Pat. Jamie  ,",NA,"Hi Vic, I received email from JJ regarding the project he is working on. He indicated that he was using some company manufacturing data in his statistics course to get input on the project. I cautioned him that this is likely against company policy and he should stop doing it until I could understand the issue better. We will have to engage HR on this before we terminate. I would like to get input from Karen on this. There are a few things we should establish before terminating JJ. We need to know that there is a clear company policy on sharing company data Need to establish that this data was confidential and that JJ knew it was confidential Need to determine if JJ was aware of company policy regarding confidential information. I will be out of the office for the next two weeks. I think we can hold off on terminating JJ until we complete this investigation and I am back in the office. Karen, I'd like your input on this one. If you think that there is a clear policy that was violated, then I could be convinced that immediate termination is appropriate.

I tried to handle each challenge as I read them andI read them in order of who I thought was the most important person to do first.I was not finished on everything but had bullet notes to follow up in front of me. 2.) Biggest issue is JJ Paxton (lead) when he is on line repairs go up. Is he stealing documents or legally working at home?! Cory Manning has great ideas on how to improve my team I intend touse. The Team has a bad idea of Sequence and it has to be turned around for them to know what a benefit it is and not poke fun especially when customers are present. 3.) With the reports i had I see the JJ issue as the biggest. I really liked Cory's ideas but need more time to implement and I feel his ideas will help the team over all. Other reports more than one tells me the group as a whole may think the new sequence is more work no more pay, it needs to be explained better. If the group improves more production more production better raises later.Original Message----- From: Assessment Administrator Sent: 4/5/2016 11:31 AM To: Pace, Jamie Cc: Subject : About your day (1 of 2)  This e-mail and the one that follows contain some final questions for you.

Regards, Jamie Pace ,","Original Message----- From: Assessment Administrator Sent: 4/5/2016 1:35 PM To: Pace, Jamie Cc: Subject : About your day (1 of 2)  This e-mail and the one that follows contain some final questions for you. Your answers to these questions will help us evaluate your performance by giving us a better understanding of your approach to the challenges you faced. It is therefore very important that you provide complete and thorough answers to the questions below and on the e-mail that follows.  To reply to the questions in these messages, simply click the Reply button above and enter your responses in the form of a reply e-mail.  1. Did you handle each challenge in the order you received it, or did you handle them another way? Please describe your approach. I began reading the emails in order to start with until I got the hang of things. Once the organizational issues were clear, I started looking at them with regard to subject and sender to determine which might impact critical items. I prioritized them as Product quality - Needed to get a plan out to Cory on the Doxy issueby close of business. Personnel - The suggestion of potential sexual harrassment by Keith Baggus jumped to the top as this could have a negative impact on sales as well as expose the company to sexual harrassment charges. The company values state that employees mustfeel safe at work. Personnel - Compatibility. The issues withLarry Hodges permeated a couple of threads. He's clearly experienced, but has difficulty accepting the changes from SEQUENCE. I had concerns thathis valuable experience maynot be included in the SEQUENCE process or he may be fighting it.There needs to be a method to incorporate his experience in a positive way to promote SEQUENCE and increase adoption. Personnel -Theplan by security to walk JJ Paxton for the disk had to be addressed immediately.Ibelieve that the IP on the disk is related to the turntable project approved by Paul Bern. This has to be understood before he's confronted, escorted out and terminated. His scores on theVictory Lunch evaluation clearly show that he's valued. A misunderstanding like that isgoing to kill his initiative and morale and send him out the door. The robot install had to be moved since Jamie would be out and they'd conflict with the audit. Since Isaac said they were flexible, this should be easy, but has to be planned ahead. Other issues were set aside for these as I didn't see them astime critical. 2. Please list the major categories of issues or problems facing Final Assembly in the Bridgeport facility of Soundproof Solutions. Morale is clearly an issue. The SEQUENCE introduction is important, but it has to take into account the workings of a mature manufacturing line. I would identify Larry Hodges as a key member of the success of this project and work to get his buy in. Once he's on board, others are going to follow. There were several insinuations made in the emails and calls which were less than professional. Calling people sneaky, insisting on full credit where it's not earned, drawing conclusions based on seeing someone on a competitors web site are too freely shared. Cory's messages show that he was aware of a number of these personality issues and doesn't appear to have addressed them. That's a problem. In his position he has to insist on constructive, professional working relations. Quality is also a significant concern.Some of the data suggests the morale issues play a part (Debby). The rework trends and totals are far too high. In that respect, the SEQUENCE cost metric should highlight the cost of rework and it should be prioritized. 3. Describe why each entry in Question 2 is an issue or problem. I think I've done that within the answers to question 2. Overall each of these deteriorates some of the key areas where this company needs to be focused. Morale, quality and cost.

Paxton is suspected of stealing company-confidential information   1. What were the three most important and the three least important e-mails to handle? Most important were: Warranty Claim, Professional Conduct and Theft of company information. Least important were Job Rotation, Suggestion Box and Victory Lunch 2. Why did you feel that the e-mails you rated as most important were critical? The firsthad impact on a major customer purchase as well as a possible quality issue. Both are key corporate focuses. Professional conduct raised the scepter of sexual harrassment and has to be addressed immediately. Theft of company propertycould impact a key employee who was working with the approval of the person who previously had thisjob. It is likely an issue ofmisinterpretation by the security head and not being careful with IP on the employee part.  3.Todays assessment provided you with background information about Soundproof Solutions and also presented thechallenging messages listed above. Were there situations where information from one source/challenge helped you to better understand and address anotherchallenge? If so, please list specific examples of theseinstances (Example: Message X related to Message Z, Company Policies related to Message Y, etc.). Clearly the message on the turntable related to the employee theft issue. The SmartChanges process in the prep material was clearly a key point for the Quinn Bower discussion. Company values sets the foundation for discussions with co-workers. Example theSafety value relates to theconcerns about professionalism and potential sexual harrassment. The letter from Al Howard on the SEQUENCE program is a clear endorsement that this is the direction.In the discussion with Robin, this helped to assure her that we're going to be better in the long run, not following SEQUENCE is not an option and we can expect some impact on production during the adoption phase.I assume that the SmartChangesevaluation process was used to address installing SEQUENCE in the first place. My expectation is that there would be a slowdown during the adoption phase and the end results would be measured."
wRewZpVnZSj,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Alex, Thanks for the feedback. I have made my team aware of your concerns. Thanks, Jamie",NA,"Shea, Let's schedule the meeting for lunch time on the 21st in room BP07. We need 30 chairs to seat everybody in Group A, Line 1. Can you work with Al on the best room layout? The problem with round tables is that if the chairs are seated around them and Al is in the front of the room, then some people will have their backs to him. See if the tables can be arranged in a semicircle with 4 chairs to a table, all on one side of the semicircle with Al in the center of the circle. If the room and furniture will accomodate this kind of arrangement and if Al is okay with it, then I think this would provide the best opportunity for all team members to see him and for him to get maximum audience participation. Thanks, Doug",NA,NA,"Cory, I left a voice mail for J.J. instructing him to wait on any purchase of material until I return. I am concerned about him sharing confidential data outside of the company. Did you or Paul give written approval for him to do so? Thanks, Doug","Isaac, Nice to meet you. The new software sounds great but I have some concerns with the implementation schedule. I am going to be away on vacation for two weeks starting tomorrow. Can we modify the schedule so that my team can get training on the new software before it is installed? I am afraid that there is great potential for the entire final assembly line to be down starting on April 15th. Wouldn't it make more sense to provide some basic training while the old software is still installed? I think my team will be able to provide better feedback if they have some idea on what the differences are between the old and new software. Here is the new schedule I propose: April 13-19: Train my team in small groups so that the line can continue to run April 20: Install the new software April 21-26: Your staff will use the software and report any issues to you. You will send the reports to me and I will act on them. April 27-30: We will make changes to the software to correct problems found by your team. May 2: We will officially roll out the new software for your team to use. Week of May 2-6: Provide additional training to my team on using the software now that it is complete. Thanks, Jamie",NA,"Cory, I'm going to postpone this victory lunch until I getback. I think it can be a good way toimprove morale and teamwork if it's done properly and I want to be directly involved (I'll buy lunch). I will talk to Pat and J.J. about the change in plans. Thanks, Doug",NA,"Vic, Thank you for bringing this to my attention. What is Soundproof Solutions' corporate policy on taking confidential information out of the plant? Are employees encouraged to take work home? Are they expected to get permission or notify a supervisor first? If J.J. has violated written company policies about managing confidential information, then I think you have no choice but to move forward with your termination plan. If he hasn't, then you and I should bring this matter to the attention of my manager and to Human Resources first. Let's talk before the end of today.

Your answers to these questions will help us evaluate your performance by giving us a better understanding of your approach to the challenges you faced. It is therefore very important that you provide complete and thorough answers to the questions below and on the e-mail that follows.  To reply to the questions in these messages, simply click the Reply button above and enter your responses in the form of a reply e-mail.  1. Did you handle each challenge in the order you received it, or did you handle them another way? Please describe your approach. I started reviewing the tasks and issues in the order they came in and then began to prioritize as more items piled up. I then tried to address in terms of priority based on revenue and other schedule constraints, such as previously schedule meetings.  2. Please list the major categories of issues or problems facing Final Assembly in the Bridgeport facility of Soundproof Solutions. - Implementation of SEQUENCE - Update of robotic software - schedule, line down and lack of training - Group A, Line 1 morale - J.J. Paxton complaints and leak of confidential information - Working environment issues with other groups (amplifier assembly) and unprofessional behavior of team members  3. Describe why each entry in Question 2 is an issue or problem. - SEQUENCE is a corporate quality initiative and my group is the lead/pilot group. My team hasn't been convinced that SEQUENCE will help them in their daily tasks or why they should embrace and engage this corporate initiative. - The software upgrade without training has the potential to shut down the final assembly line for days and it is schedule to happen while I'm out of the office so I can't manage the team through the issues. - Team morale seems bad, especially on Robin's team. They are dissatisified and less productive than they should be. - J.J. appears to be a problem employee in many ways - complainer, higher returns when he subs for people, makes big decisions on equipment and other changes without proper input or approvals, does not protect corporate secrets. - There appear to be big opportunities for efficiency improvements with better coordination and teamwork between the groups. There is potential to lose customers and sales due to public, unprofessional behavior.

I Suggest that you need not worry about this , you may be right in saying these workers are not aware of the technology that we use but these workers also bring new practices and fresh perspective that we'll be able to put to good use. Dont worry about it even it comes we'll have them trained and put them into the suitbale roles.

I desparately want to believe it's not true , having said that i must insist that it's not desirable at all to have this kind of feedback on our professional conduct. I urge all of you to personally ensure this kind of behaviour is avoided in front of customers to avoid any harsh steps. We have another visit on Apr 26th I expect that we behave like professionals and mature people and showcase the same to our valued cutomers. Seeking everyone's support.

Else it's ok that you go ahead , i'll not be there next two weeks hence request you to coordinate with my group leaders for any support. Regards Cory",NA,"Hi Jamie It's a good initiative for developing our team leaders , I suggest that we involve Robin as well in the next excercise . As far as winners' name is concern please announce the winners' name based upon the survey results. But must ensure that good attributes of each are mentioned in front of the group. At the same time from the survey i find both scoring very high on blaming others (3.8 and 3.5 against 2.3) which is not correct , they need more coaching on people handling. I suggest that you take out some time and discuss with each one on this , after you share your feedback I'll decide if also need to sit with them Regards Cory",NA,"Hi Daisha I get your concern and appreciate it , In this case I checked with JJ and found that he was telling the truth . He 's a second generation employee and is honest in his approach. I suggest that the matter is not as serious as it looks like , please do not worry. To avoid this type of problems in the future I 'll speak to IT dept to disable any USB/CD ports/drives so that no one can copy any data without IT approvals this solves the problem. Hope it helps .

zaLcijpFSWN,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"J.J. I understand your concerns about absorbing some of the team members from another plant. It can't be difficult to teach others something that you can do so well. It's important that you take the knowledge and understanding that you have for something and give it to the others. For the SEQUENCE project to work and work as a great success that it can be, we will all have to work together. I believe that with your skill, desire and understanding of our line, the processes and the new programs, you can do that. You have an incredible desire to see progress made. It's obvious from our turntable discussion, that you want to see great things for this plant and that is all of us. Every team is only as good as it's weakest team member. Let's work together to make all of our team members as strong as you whether they come from this plant or another. Everyone learns at a different speed and don't forget you will probably be teaching me all the things that you know before it's over. I know I am certainly going to call on you quite a bit.

This might be a great chance for them to hear more encouraging words from some one else.I will return from my vacation on the 20th and it will be very busy when I return. The proposed date of the 21st at lunch may be a great time for the meeting. Lunch will be provided and it will be like a reward for the team members who are working with the new robot program. It will also be beneficial for me to hear more about it when I return. I am looking forward to the presentation and lunch with the team members.","Jennifer, I appreciate you taking time to send me the information about Line 1. I am still trying to get caught up on all the previous activities from when Paul was here. There has been some suggestion about some of the root causes for the absenteeism and lower than standard work. I am currently looking into this and will do all that I can do today to begin a plan for correcting the errors. ' I am just as anxious in making certain that SEQUENCE is a hit. This will do great things for the company and the plant itself. Not to mention the morale of the workers if we are the pilot plant and make this a huge success. I would love to have zero defects and eliminate the need for repairs altogether. I feel that if we all work together on the processes, we should be able to come up ways to make defects a thing of the past. Thanks again,",NA,"J.J. Sounds like you have been very busy and have poured your heart into this. I wish I could give you more information on what Paul had found, but unfortunately, I can not. When I return I will begin investigating if there is any suppliers who can do the manufacture and install. I might get lucky and find the one that Paul had received the quotes from. Let me know when would be a good time to meet. When I return, the new software will be installed and we may be dealing with some training issues. I will have a conference call on the 22nd starting around 8:30. Just let me know what time may be an option for you. Would love to help you with this, sounds like a great plan.","To All, Please note that Friday April 15th, new software will be uploaded to our robots. This will of course have a negative affect on production for that day. If we need pull ahead with some of our production and build our numbers, please let me know. I will also contact Isaac and request that the training be moved from May 2-6 to April 18th through the 22nd. If anyone has any other questions or concerns, please contact Isaac and copy me.

I do know that J.J. had been working on a turntable for improving work performance. I wish that you had not confronted him without discussing the matter with myself or Cory. I am certain that downloading data about our operations is not tolerated, I hope that it was for research on his turntable idea. He had been working with his Statistics professor on improving the efficiency. I will discuss the issue with Cory and if possible I would like to examine the data that was downloaded. Let me see what the guidelines are and we will determine which route is best to take. Thank you for investigation and concern for the company.

All the team members and all the departments need to trust one another and try to work together to make each process the best it can be. Without trust, the departments will fight to blame the other for scrap or any issue that comes up. c. Team members need to be reassured that the changes that take place are for thegood of all. That it was not set up to benefit management only. They need to have explanations as to why these things take place. d. If one department blames the other for something that they send out, it only adds friction. The different areas need to be on the same page. Perhaps they could assist them and discuss with them what issues they receive from the previous area. Here, they were intentionally sending defective parts to ruin their numbers. e. The issues that Paul and Quinn had were causing the departments to fight and blame each other. Nothing was being resolved. It was just getting worse. f. There had been a trial before Paul left and the team members didn't know what was happening. There was no planning before to discuss what was about to happen.

Why did you feel that the e-mails you rated as most important were critical? Theft of company information was important because not all of the facts were there. Security was ready to fire him as soon as they saw what was happening. I believe it was a mis-understanding and I hope that J.J. had approval for getting information. It was probably for his project. If he had permission to get the information, 1. It was not handled correctly and should have been done by an Information Specialist, 2. If he had permission and was going to be fired, that team member will never do anything above and beyond just showing up for work and being very unhappy. 3. No one,other than security, checked to see what information had been downloaded.  Warranty Claim because it could mean the loss of a potentially strong customer. This needs to be investigated thoroughly by someone other than someone who came in for his first day and is not sure who needs to be contacted for assistance.  The fact that no one really understood what SEQUENCEis all about and the one person that will be leading up the activity loses there temper with another over it. This will cause resentment with that team member and will not want to accept the new program. 3.Todays assessment provided you with background information about Soundproof Solutions and also presented thechallenging messages listed above.

If so, please list specific examples of theseinstances (Example: Message X related to Message Z, Company Policies related to Message Y, etc.). I did. The emails from J.J. showed me that he was excited about improving his area and was excited to take his investigation further. Hehad addressed his Statistics professor about thedata that hehad been working on. He wanted to know what I knew about the manufacturing and installation of the turn table. This also gave me insightinto what he might have been downloading. This made me believe that what he downloaded had to be moredata about the work area. It may have even been information that he wasworking on for himself and not truly, just critical information about the company. The email that I received from Patshowed me how some of the team members felt about Quinn and his department.

IImrOhksjug,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Tracy, This certainly looks like an interesting project. I do howver have a number of concerns, whilst I appreciate you taking an interst in the strategic direction of Soundproof Solutions, taking classified data away from the office without authorisation is against company policy. I know Liang has already spoken with you about this, and whilst it is in effect a dismissable offence, at thsi time we have agreeed to offer you the benefit of the doubt. In addtion, the assesment of customer service data whilst though does not include amy external factors so I think in this instance it would not be truly representatative of our customer services operations. With this in mind please delete all data, if you have not already, and do not share further with any other individuals either within the company or externaly. Soundproff Solutions takes matters of security very seriously, and please consider this a warning. Cary ,",NA,NA,"Taylor, Congratulations on your mentoring scheme, it sounds very comprehensive. It sounds like Jerry has been doing a great job, however regarding the metric provided I would have a few concerns basisng the decison entirely on the results. Whilst you have applied a law of averages to the overall performance, there are obviously some areas- such as communication and relationship with colleagues where Jerry is lacking. My advice would be to keep up the mentoring, maybe hooking up with Marge Dalton in HR to formalsie things alittle more clearly, and work on the areas in which Jerry is lacking. I ceratinly think we have a good performer there, but I'm not convinced based on your assesment he is quite 'rounded' enough yet to step-up. Maybe we should bne looking at other people in the team to cover you on your break ? Why don't you speak to Kim and find out if she has any staff members who are looking for an opportunity to step up in your absence ? Enjoy your time off! Cary ,",NA,"Haley, Thank you, thsi is great news for the team. I will take a more detailed look at the taems backgrounds and get back to you by close of buisness today. Cary , Hayley, Thanks for the great news, will be really good for both productivityand team morale. I have assesed the scores, and feel that we need to strike the right note of performance versus productivity. Having met with Jess earlier I do have some concerns we are in danger occasionaly of sacrificing quality in terms of quantity. I have also consulted Barney's notes on mentality and performance and have decided I would like to offer the FT role to Ashley Payne. Ashley has shown good consistency across both criteria, plus he has the maturity and grasp of process to provide a key member of the team. Barney has noted he is asolid performer and works well, and I'm confident he can go far. Whilst the quantitive data showed Blaine as high performing, he works best whilst heavily supervised and therefore may not have the complement of charateristics we require for a full cohesive team. Thanks, Cary",NA,NA,"Thanks Haley, I will take a look and get back to you before the end of the day. Cary , Hayley, Thanks- again great opportunities for the team. Decisions as follows: Sandy Martin- Solid performer, has completed all the neccesary training- no concerns regarding next levels. Quinn Lebare- although fairly junior, he has performed well agaisnt all competencies teamwork and customer service- a bit of a wildcard maybe but has the ability to do well- has done well in his mentoring has also completed all of his training. Jess Rollins- Whilst she would use all three training credits, Jess scores well agaisnt all citeria, and importantly is hungry for the next step. Well reagrded by my predeccesor, Jess is an important senior member of the team and disregarding her at thsi stage represents a risk of losing her altogether. Cary",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Taylor, Thank you for escalating this to me, and many thank for your dilligence. Thisis a difficult situation, and one I would wish to handle personally. Mr Wedder is a big customer, and also of some influence within the community and I think it owuld be rash to accuse him of any inpropriety withough sufficient eviidence. I will speak to Mr Wedder personaly and find out from him exactly waht problems his clients have been facing to need such a large number of replacement rolls. I will also point out that our offer of a free replacement is arbitary based on an understanding of defect beyond the purchasers control. In future I will suggest Mr Wedder brings any damaged or innapropriate samples in to the office to discuss the issues in hand. In my experience, if he is purposely under ordering, this attention should be enough to prevent any further incidents. Please keep me informed of any further developments, Cary ,","Liang, Thanks for the mail, i totally appreciate your keen eyesight and security dilligance.. However, in this instance, I think the situation is fairly innocuous. I know Tracy has been studying out of hours for a statistics class and has been using Sound proof Solutions as a case study. I have only been aware of this since this morning, and at this point I'm not sure if Tracy had clearance from my predeccesor to use confiedential information. Either way it is not something I wish to encourage, or condone, however Tracy has a strong track record with the organisation and I would appreciate giving him the benefit of the doubt. I will bring this up with Tracy personally today, to warn him of the potential dangers of accessing classified information, and I am confident this will not happen again. Thank you again for bringing this up with me.

Your answers to these questions will help in the evaluation of your performance by providing a better understanding of your approach and rationale. It is important that you provide complete and thorough answers to the questions below.  For your reference, a list of messages you received today is shown after question 4.  1. Please list the major categories of issues or problems facing Customer Service Team 5 of Soundproof Solutions. Why is each an issue or a problem? Communications- Weak management has left the team with poor channels of communicating with other teams within the organisation and alsowith each other. This has manifested itself in disengagement, low moraleand unclear expectations of behaviour and /or duty. Weak leadership- Employees are quickto go off and make judgements and decisions- albeit qualifying them first. Management shouldcraete a culture where importanat decsions are notformalsied before management is informed.  2. What were the three most important messages you considered the highest priorities to handle? Why? Fletcher Systems- Potential loss of big sales, needs to be adressed immediately Hiltop Hotel- Similar Cyd Atkins- Needed a response for client within the day 3. List specific examples (if any) of instances where you detected a relationship between two of the messages you received in your inbox. For example, when you decided how respond to one message, did you consider information provided not only in that message, but in other message(s)?

While I can understand your frustrations with Debby we must also think about the fairness in just moving her to another team. While this would resolve your immediate issue it will only move the problem to another location. We must work as a team to resolve issues like this.  I would like for you to work with Debby while I am on vacation. Try to understand why she is absent so often to see if there is something that we can do to help. Sometimes personal issues are brought to work and can negatively affect performance. It may just be that she needs someone to listen and help if possible. Please take the inititive to help her improver her performance and if we cannot make any improvements by the time I get back then we will look into what the next steps are going to be. For now we cannot just move her to another area, that is not fair to either Deeby or the new team. Thanks Jamie.","JJ, We can discuss this when I return from vacation.

Thanks Jamie",NA,"Cory, I jusreceived this email from Paul and wanted to share it with you. It appears that you will be buying lunch for Pat Landis. We should also consider a small token of appreciation for JJ, maybe a desert for his efforts. I have already contacted themso they are awareof the results Jamie,",NA,"Vic, Please do not move forward with you plan. JJ has been working on a SEQUENCE project for the trim line. Part of this process is statistical analysis of data. JJ has been taking evening classes in statistics and has worked taht data with the class and his professor. This was known about and the data analysis has been very important to the project. If the data is confidential then we will address that with the team. Lets have a meeting when I get back from vacation to discuss the handling of data under these types of circumstances in the future. I will talk to JJ about this before hand. We should not move forward with any diciplinary actions since this was done as a process improvement to help the company and is part of what SEQUENCE is all about. Please get in touch with me immediately so that I know you have received this email and that any actions will be put on hold.

Your answers to these questions will help us evaluate your performance by giving us a better understanding of your approach to the challenges you faced. It is therefore very important that you provide complete and thorough answers to the questions below and on the e-mail that follows.  To reply to the questions in these messages, simply click the Reply button above and enter your responses in the form of a reply e-mail.  1. Did you handle each challenge in the order you received it, or did you handle them another way? Please describe your approach. I reviewed the initial email list and attempted toassign a priority to them. WIth limited time with thefake company some of my priorities shifted during the day.  2. Please list the major categories of issues or problems facing Final Assembly in the Bridgeport facility of Soundproof Solutions. Quality appears to be one of the issues, the other major item that was present was office politics and personal opinions that were shared in numerous emails. Then communication was something that i sensed was lacking, there were times where areas were acting only for the good of the area. Proper communication can resolve some of these issues.  3. Describe why each entry in Question 2 is an issue or problem. Quality is always an issue no matter where you are. Personal opinions are present everywhere, the hardest part of leading people is seperating the facts from teh personal issues. Communication, what more can be said, we must communicate, not to the extent that everyone shares everything but simple quick communication can solve some major issues. This allows people to feelas if they are part of solution.

Paxton is suspected of stealing company-confidential information   1. What were the three most important and the three least important e-mails to handle? Most important - Waranty Claim, Theft Email, Team Focus Least Important - Suggestion box, victory lunch,Debby Britzki  2. Why did you feel that the e-mails you rated as most important were critical? The theft email was a higher priority once I was what it was about. This was obviousely a serious issue and for the most part a misunderstanding. This needed immediate attention and did not get it because I processed the earlier emails first. I did more follow up on it since it was time sensitive and could result in major disruptions while I was gone. Waranty claimsince it involves quality and company revenue. Team Focus since it involves the teams ability to create good product. This leads to more revenue and fewer issues in the field.  3.Todays assessment provided you with background information about Soundproof Solutions and also presented thechallenging messages listed above. Were there situations where information from one source/challenge helped you to better understand and address anotherchallenge? If so, please list specific examples of theseinstances (Example: Message X related to Message Z, Company Policies related to Message Y, etc.).  The team focus email helped in teh waranty email since teh date had some corelation to the issues in the field. Other emails where certain individuals names were mentioned frequently also will aid in teh responses since they give a window into the actual people. The videos not working are a hinderance since body language plays a large role in intrepreting teh real meaning."
cfrfLJAtmep,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"I will schedule a morning meeting with Larry today prior to my leaving on vacation, this must be addressed and can not wait for me to come back from vacation. I will review with Larry the amount of money that using SEQUENCE will save the company and further explain how it will benefit him in his day to day job. Understanding that it is different than how they use to make changes in the good old days but it doesn't mean that they are any less efficient. Once he begins to understand why the changes are necessary and how they will benefit him in the long run I will then remind him that his approach towards Emily was both unprofessional and unwelcomed. I will explain that I'm sure he didn't mean it to come out that way it did and he owes her an apology because she's just doing her job.",NA,"Hi J.J., I understand your level of frustration there's nothing more frustrating than having someone on a team that doesn't help but hurts the team. I would like to pose a challenge to you while I'm gone, when she's having a bad day or her rework rates are jumping talk to her...she's a teammate and maybe just having that person to talk to might make all of the difference. As for the absenteeism, I'll look into that when I get back. Remember, it's always easy for a team when everything is going well and everyone is accountable, the true challenge becomes what to do when you have that one person who throws you off. The answer isnt' to just get rid of the problem, the answer is to work the problem and let's resolve it. Why don't we revisit this when I get back and see where we're at with it? Thanks, Jamie","Hi J.J., I haven't heard anything about us absorbing workers from Kirkland but if it's true then the management team would look at their skill sets and absorb them where we feel they would best serve the company. As for the training curve, we can't push someone off to another group simply because we don't want to train them because we feel that they are going to take to long. We are a very strong team and I am confident that no matter who we would incorporate into our team we as a whole would ensure they were trained properly ...and yes it might take a while but didn't your mom and dad take time to teach you to drive? Learning is different for everyone and should be handled that way, we should never judge someone because they learn slower, they may learn slower but be better with quality becaus they are slower. These are all decisions that management will face if and when that absorbtion were to take place. Thanks, Jamie",NA,"Hi Alex, I apologize for my teams' behavior and can assure you it will be addressed. Thanks, Jamie",NA,"Hi Shea, Thanks for the heads up regarding how my team views SEQUENCE, we would like to take room BP07 from 2-3pmon April 21st. I'll send out an email for everyone. Thanks, Jamie","Hi Jennifer, Thank you for sharing this information with me, it will allow me to address a few issues within the department. If it wouldn't be to much trouble can you show me how to run this report? I think this would be a great KPI for the team to see (just the graph part of course). Thanks, Jamie",NA,"Hi J.J., Let me start by saying ""WOW"" what a great job you have done with the research to find a better more efficient way of doing things on the floor. I do need to remind you that although your idea sounds wonderful we really need to involve Carson Spikes in this process before we can proceed. He may have a different take on the process, he may have a better way of doing it and he and his department may be able to create the turntable themselves. For these reasons we can't jump ahead and order things without giving him the opportunity to be involved. I will call him and ask that he set some time aside to review what you have and then let's all sit down when I get back and discuss what the two of you have come up with. I will schedule us to meet sometime on the 21st, this way it leaves the time open for both you and Carson but we can meet that day and see where we are at in that process. Great job J.J.!! Thanks, Jamie",NA,NA,"HiCory, For the victory lunch Pat won the contest. I know that you were interested in who won so I wanted to let you know since you will be attending in my absence. Thanks, Jamie",NA,"Hi everyone, As you can see from Vic's email J.J. took some information off site to work on from home. I do know that he did work on a project of improvement at home inwhich he used outside help and our information. I understand the policies for taking company information off site and wanted to make sure that all of the proper personnel were aware of what was going on prior to Vic walking him off site.  Thanks, Jamie","I tried to handle each email as it came in, seeing some of the subjects made me respond to some of those sooner such as company theft. Some of the major points of concern for Jamie would be enforcing policies, teaching teamwork, holding employees accountable to the policies and overall improving morale. Policies have to be enforced there are no gray areas there, the policies are there for a reason and the manager needs to enforce them and the employees need to understand that they are held accountable to them. Teamwork, and improving morale go hand in hand as you increase one you increase the other, a good manager will be a good and effective communicator. Most morale issues can be traced back to a feeling of not being involved which can be solved through effective communication. I don't believe in problems but challenges so for that reason I see all of these simply as challenges, teams that need good leadership make great teams.Original Message----- From: Assessment Administrator Sent: 4/5/2016 11:31 AM To: Pace, Jamie Cc: Subject : About your day (1 of 2)  This e-mail and the one that follows contain some final questions for you.

Please describe your approach.  - I do not go in order: in some cases, I take additional time to consider how I word something. In others, I know that I need to wait (as in the Quinn case -- I didn't want to reply to Pat before talking to Quinn). I also tend to reply to quick-response messages during in-between times (such as between meetings).  2. Please list the major categories of issues or problems facing Final Assembly in the Bridgeport facility of Soundproof Solutions.  - Morale is generally poor. The team needs to see a strong leader who has faith in the corporate SEQUENCE initiative and drives it in a reasonable manner. Communication between individuals is frequenty hostile and unproductive.  3. Describe why each entry in Question 2 is an issue or problem. - Poormoraleleads directly to absenteeism. I have coworkers who take sick days because they don't like their jobs or the people they work with. - When a corporate initiative doesn't have support at the lowest levels, it's because it's not being pushed at some point on the chain or not sold appropriately. This causes distrust in leadership -- an 'Us v. Them' mentality that feeds the first issue (Morale). A leader who keeps the ship running but doesn't neglect the opinions of subordinates will help. - Hostilitybetween coworkers is like having a spy among us. If we'refighting each other, we can't fight the competition -- there's plentyofothers out there hoping that we tear ourselves apart from the inside. We needtorespect each other -- we don't need to like each other, but without basic respect we can'texpect to play as a team.

XasoAtWLXfa,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"J.J., As a team leader, I want you to work with Debby to help improve her performance through positive reinforcement.

If you need guidance, then please come to me directly and we can discuss. Cory ,","J.J. Thank you for sharing your thoughts, but we will follow the company's selection process. Even though, these employees have been with the companies for years and may not be updated on the latest technologies. I feel that they will provide valuable insight and will not present major retraining issues. The years with the company should be viewed as a valuable asset. Regards, Corey ,",NA,"Alex, Thank you for bring this to my attention. I will address this unprofessional conduct with my entire team.

JJ and a group have developed a turntable that potentially will improve effeciencies on the shop floor. The information that was downloaded was for his statistic class that was helping him analyze the data for a more effecient solution. Vic, I find it troubling that you would remove items from someone knapsack or purse without the knowledge owner. I will meet with JJ today concerning this issue and discuss the companies confideniality policies, but as an employee in good standing and team lead is granted access to confidential information. Additionally, I would like to discuss this with my Group Leaders and Paul upon my return. For all we know, Paul agreed and supported to JJ using company information for the turntable project.

Please list the major categories of issues or problems facing Final Assembly in the Bridgeport facility ofSoundproof Solutions. Quality Issues Poor employee morale Lack of team cohensiveness Anomosity toward other departments 3. Describe why each entry in Question 2 is an issue or problem. Poor quality - shows a lack of concern for the companies overall success and may be issues that the company shows little concern for the employee Poor morale - the perspections that management does not care about the concerns of the worker, which directly impacts quality and overall work environment - increase stress and anomosity between coworkers and other departments Lack of cohensiveness- who do have a vested interested in their group, don't have a vested interested in the company, which leads to waste, poor quality, high absenteeism, etc. Anomosity - is a direct results of poor morale and the lack of cohensiveness.

Turntable proposal: New turntable design for trim install - I was interested in how an employee showed initiated, but concerned that he may be moving forwarded too quickly without allowing current management to fully reviewing the proposal.  Victory lunch: Al and Paul will buy lunch for the group leader with better performance survey results - The reward was stated to be based on the best performance, but Paul was willing to introduce some subjectivity to the selection process. I based on my selection on who was the best overal performer.  Interaction you saw earlier today: Larry Hodges and Emily Carson disagree about SEQUENCE -the scene was inapropriate. The manager should show support for company initiatives even he or she may not totally agree with every aspect. To the team members, managers must show 100% support.  Debby Britzki: Request to move a team member with performance problems to another team - I was mildly taken aback by the team leaders attitude. It was unprofessional. If there are truly issues with an employee, then I would like to review the documentation detailing inappropriate behavior and review if team leaders and managers have attempted corrective actions.  Kirkland plant: Concern about team members transferring from an older plant - similar to the response above. Shows a lack of professionalism on the part of team leaders. Management training and development is necessary.  Team focus: Data indicate higher error rates when the team lead cant support the group  Upgrades to robot software: IT proposes software rollout plan - though important, the rollout can be delayed until my return.  Professional conduct: Salesperson unnerved by team member behavior during customer tour - concerned and disappointed in what was observed - there appears to be a lack of leadership in this group. Cory will have her hands full getting this group back on track.  SEQUENCE talk: Workers grumbling over extra effort without extra pay under SEQUENCE  Corporate audit: Request to prepare department for corporate review of operations  Suggestion box: Proposal for an incentive plan to increase team members suggestions  Warranty claim: Request for a plan to investigate warranty claims for a customers new units  Job rotation: Suggestion that team members rotate jobs to minimize boredom and errors  Theft of company information: J.J. Paxton is suspected of stealing company-confidential information- It appears that individuals are too wiling to make judgement calls based on too little information. Instead of asking why JJ was downloading company information, the security officer assumed that JJ actions were illegal.  1.

Thanks, Cory , Team Leads, Pleae address with your groups. Remind them that professional conduct is expected at all times. Feedback received regarding conduct at work isshown below: --- You should know that salespeople assigned to our region occasionally use the Bridgeport plant to hold tours for potential customers. Its a good opportunity for the salespeople to show our advanced manufacturing techniques. Unfortunately, we ran into a problem last week when a salesperson brought in representatives from a major potential account. As she led them past the Trim Install break area, she could overhear two team members making fun of SEQUENCE. They were having a good time making up silly things to be measured against, then taking turns disciplining each other for being very far off their goals.  At another point in the tour, one of the guests, who was apparently quite attractive, mentioned tothe salespersonhow much she appreciated the opportunity to see our people work as they built the NoiseBreakers. Velma heard someone whistle and one of the team members say, You can watch me work anytime.  Please make sure that your team members understand how important it is to act professionally around customers. And this should also extend to keeping their work areas clean - Salesperson also mentioned that there were some areas around Trim Install that were littered with bits of plastic and empty food wrappers.",NA,"Lets do this during Lunch since food will be provided,. lets put it in BPO7 in the event any of the multimedia equipment is needed. Please Send and invite to all of the Final Assembly team members on my behalf. Cory ,","Jennifer, thanks for bringing this to my attention. Just looking at the data it appears we have a higher defect rate when JJ is covering absences. I have met with the lead on line 1 to try and resolve with absentee issue.

Now, I am not putting you up to such a challenge but it is too easy to just move someone. Has anyone sat down with Debby and discuss these issues with her? If not, that is where i want you to start. You should discuss with her attendance and rework rate. If her attendance is truly that bad, she should be on some kind of disciplinary actions in accordance with the company's attendance policy. Please review her attendance and make certain that she is aware of where she stands. As for her quality of work, it should follow the same process; document the issue, communicate the issue, set the expectations, monitor her performance, and give feedback. Please do not just simply want to move Debbie. I do not support moving bad employees from one area to the next. If we follow the proper process, she will improve her performance or be released. However, she would have at least been informed of where she is not meeting expectations and have been given an opportunity to meet those expectations. I will be out of the plant for the next few weeks, returning on Wed. April 20th. Please schedule a follow-up discussion with me upon my return to let me know how things are going with Debbie.

We have a lot of work to do. ,",NA,NA,"Hi all Please review the email below from Alex Norman. The behavior described below is completely unacceptable, therefore I want you all to implement the following: 1. During Customer visits, they have to be accompanied by a Group Leader at all time, this will not only allow for clear explanation of our process, but also to ensure the safety. 2. Any inappropriate behavior from our team members must be documented and progressive discipline must be applied. We must be customer oriented and inappropriate behavior wont be tolerated, we are a professional corporation and everyone shall behave accordingly. Since this incident happened last week, I do not want to address the team members mentioned below individually. However I want you all to have meeting today with all work teams and make sure that they understand that we expect everyone to behave professionally, and we will also address any and all inappropriate conduct. I want all team members to be aware so there are no surprises when we pursue any violation.

I know you are very exited about moving forward with the turntable, however I have to ask not to contact Barrett and do not place an order yet. We shall schedule a meeting as soon as I come back from my vacation to go over the dataand I will make sure that Carlson also gets involved with this, I do not want to go ahead with line changes without all stakeholders involved; we want to ensure there is concensus from engineering. Please contact Shea to schedule the appointment in my absence, and we shall talk soon. Regards ,","Hi Issac, We seem to be putting the cart before the horse. Please change the schedule to: April 18-22: : Train the team on using the software Sat April 23: Install software on one production line April 25-29: Your staff will use the software and report any issues. I need someone from IT present all day on Monday to ensure it boots up and works properly for one day, and to capture failures to act on them Friday 29: Team review to ensure test line is successful Sat April 30: If test line is successful, install software on lines 2 and 3 Week of May 2-6: Test week, one IT team member available all day Monday May 8th:Official launch Thanks ,",NA,"As discussed, we shall do it when I return as I believe it is important for me to be there Thanks ,",NA,"Vic, JJ made me aware of a Smartchange project he was working on turntables, and also on the fact that he presented some information to his peers at a course he is taking in statistics. I actually put a stop to this project until I investigate further. JJ stated that Paul knew about it. I do not know more details; I am ccing Paul as he might be able to provide more insight and confirm if he gave JJ approval. I will forward you JJ's email, you can request him backup where he requested approval from Paul. Ultimately if JJ is in violation of any company policy that he has been made aware of; then I agree with you to perform appropriate action, I would only caution that any action properly documented and supported.

I will address this a soon as I can. Thank you for bringing it to my attention. Jamie","JJ, We will not be able to pick and choose who we get from the Kirkland plant. I am sure we will get a mixed bag of people. This will be our opportunity to practice our teaching, leadership, patience perhaps and respect values. Let's have a lead meeting when I get back from vacation to discuss how we might integrate the new people into our groups. Perhaps we can use the training department to help with classes on the process and computer systems that we currently use in our facility. Perhaps they can start the training while the folks are still at the Kirkland plant. I am sure if you have these concerns that Robin and Pat have the same concerns. Let's see if we can put together a smooth transition plan for the folksfrom Kirkland. It is to our advantage to have them trained and confident in the process as quickly as possible so any remedial training required needs to be done quickly. Why don't you put together a meeting with Pat and Robin while I am gone and come up with some ideas. That will save time when I get back. I would like you to take the lead on this. Jamie",NA,NA,NA,"Shea, Lets do lunch on the 21 in room BPO7. I will notify all of my folks and thanks for the tip. I will have an idea what to expect. Jamie",NA,NA,"Vic, and Karen, Based on this e-mail. I think the investigation into stealing company information can be quite short. JJ has admitted in this e-mail that he took the data and what the reason was for taking the data. Based on this, I will not support a suspension to conduct an investigation and will not support Termination, but I will do a write up for his file and make sure that JJ understands that he cannot take propriatary information from Soundproof without the appropriate permission. I will have this discussion and do the write up when I return from vacation. Jamie","Issac, I look forward to meeting you as well. I want to make sure that someone from the IT group will be on the shop floor when we cut over to the new software system. The operators need to understand the differences between the old software and the new software and be able to run the new software. I will discuss with the team lead and assign an operator to the tool for the test period. That person and the lead will need training on the operation of the new software and the adjustments that the operators can make. I also need someone to be available during production hours to respond quickly to any software issues we will have the will take the tool down from production during the test period. In your talks with Al, have you discussed the impact the test period will have on production in my area. If this software has start up issues, we will see a drop in output from this tool and this could have an impact on the output from the Final Assembly line. I will forward this e-mail to Cory and Al with these requirements and my concern about the effect this may have on cycle time through Final Assembly. Jamie",NA,"Pat and JJ, Looks like it was a tough competition. Both of you made great strides. Pat actually won but both of you made great strides. We will schedule a lunch at Cory's expense when I get back to reveiw the data further and determine what we can impliment from your experiences. Jamie",NA,"Vic, I am not as familiar with the HR policy at Soundproof as I am at other companies I have worked but isn't there a process of progressive discipiline? I realize this is a serious charge but I believe we should do some additional investigation before termination at this point. Let's suspend him until we have had an opportunity to conduct a through investigation of this issue to see if there is a pattern of behavior or if indeed he was going to do some additiona work from home. Don't get me wrong. The result of the investigation may be termination but I don't think we have enough information to treminate now. I will set up a meeting with HR to discuss. Let's work together on this.

Please list the major categories of issues or problems facing Final Assembly in the Bridgeport facility of Soundproof Solutions. When you have a group of people working together you have a group of diverse backgrounds, experience, and diverse acceptable behavior. Guiding people to acceptable behavior is always the challenage. Discovering what is driving the behavior and how to channel that to the workplace acceptable behavior standard can make all the difference in group behavior and ultimately from a manufacturing perspective, increased output. Holding people accountable for their behavior is important. People must believe there are consequences for unacceptable behavior or not meeting the goals of the organization. If you don't there is discontent in the group. Change is also a big factor. Bridgeport has just embraced the SEQUENCE plan that is very different expectation that some people are use to. Change is always uncomfortable. In a work place, it is sometimes perceived as the plan of the day so is not so easily embraced.  3. Describe why each entry in Question 2 is an issue or problem.

I did also want to mention that I recieved an email from our security group earlier today and they had some concerns with how you handled the data used for this project. As you can appreciate, we are in a very competitive business and any company propriatery information that gets into the hands of our competitors could be detrimental. I understand that you had good intentions, however, we cannot be sharing data with individuals that are not employed by Soundproof Solutions. Please do not share any company information with individuals moving forward.

To respond, simply click the Reply button above and enter your answers in the form of a reply e-mail.   Turntable proposal: New turntable design for trim install - Thought that the team needed to review with Engineering prior to moving forward...  Victory lunch: Al and Paul will buy lunch for the group leader with better performance survey results - Tough to make a decision on those ratings since Jamie would not have known their performance first hand. Had to rely on Paul who may or may not have a bias.  Interaction you saw earlier today: Larry Hodges and Emily Carson disagree about SEQUENCE - Seemed to be a common disagreement. Due to time restrictions, had to call each of them and push off until I returned. Tried to get the message across that they need to work together and leverage one anothers abilities.  Debby Britzki: Request to move a team member with performance problems to another team - Considered low priority and indicated in a voicemail that we would address when I return  Kirkland plant: Concern about team members transferring from an older plant - Considered low priority and indicated in a voicemail that we would address when I return  Team focus: Data indicate higher error rates when the team lead cant support the group  Upgrades to robot software: IT proposes software rollout plan  Professional conduct: Salesperson unnerved by team member behavior during customer tour - Left message with the Alex indicating that I agreed 100% and that I need to meet with the teams when I return to discuss in preparation for the 4/26 meeting.  SEQUENCE talk: Workers grumbling over extra effort without extra pay under SEQUENCE  Corporate audit: Request to prepare department for corporate review of operations - In my absence, assigned each of the team leads with preparing their respective teams and pointed them to Sam if additional assistance is needed.  Suggestion box: Proposal for an incentive plan to increase team members suggestions - Emailed Cory indicating that it was a good idea, however, a low priority that needs addressed when I return  Warranty claim: Request for a plan to investigate warranty claims for a customers new units - Established closure plan with JJ to address in my absence.  Job rotation: Suggestion that team members rotate jobs to minimize boredom and errors  Theft of company information: J.J. Paxton is suspected of stealing company-confidential information - Called Vic to resolve the issue. Just a misunderstanding. Also requested formal training moving forward to eliminate these issues.   1. What were the three most important and the three least important e-mails to handle? Most Important - Theft of company information (Did not want employee to be fired unrightfully) - Warranty Claim (Important to support customer meeting before returning) - Corporate Audit (Need to make a good impression on Corporate) Least Important - Kirkland plant - Debby Britzki - Suggestion Box  2. Why did you feel that the e-mails you rated as most important were critical?

Were there situations where information from one source/challenge helped you to better understand and address anotherchallenge? If so, please list specific examples of theseinstances (Example: Message X related to Message Z, Company Policies related to Message Y, etc.). Orginizational charts were definately a big help.

I understand he is an old hand and has seen many such improvement programs in his days. But he has to be made understood that with the growing competition in the field , we require such programs to survive and he should be a major contributor to the program since he can provide with the insight of his vast experience in this factory. I expect a greater cooperation from Larry . You could make hm the incharge for the implementation of SEQUENCE in your team and then maybe he would feel in charge and help us out.

I have already initiated a process to deal with absenteesm with Jamie and Sam Thanks Cory ,",NA,NA,"Hi Alex, I hope you must have seen my mail to my assembly line guys . I think you should not have any problems in this regard for your next factory visit. Thanks Cory , Jamie and Sam, I need you guys to look in to the matter in the trailing mail. I don;t want a repeat of what has happened earlier. I think you should call the guys involved and have a talk with them about their behaviour. Give them a clear message that this kind of behaviour is not at all allowed and will not go unpunished in the future. Further keep an eye on them especially during Velma's next visit. I want your personal attention on this. Also get me a complete list of people who remain absent regularly and try to find the reason behind their absenteesm. I will deal with it once I get back. Regarding rework reduction, SEQUENCE should be up and running and I am hopefull that it would help in reducing the reworking. Thanks Cory Hi,  You should know that salespeople assigned to our region occasionally use the Bridgeport plant to hold tours for potential customers. Its a good opportunity for the salespeople to show our advanced manufacturing techniques. Unfortunately, we ran into a problem last week when Velma Miller brought in representatives from a major potential account. As she led them past the Trim Install break area, she could overhear two team members making fun of SEQUENCE. They were having a good time making up silly things to be measured against, then taking turns disciplining each other for being very far off their goals. Velma thinks they were Larry Hodges and Harry Vitz.  At another point in the tour, one of the guests, who was apparently quite attractive, mentioned to Velma how much she appreciated the opportunity to see our people work as they built the NoiseBreakers. Velma heard someone whistle and one of the team members say, You can watch me work anytime. It was probably Keith Baggus, as hes been known to make similar comments.  Velma wasnt sure if any of the customers heard that, but she thought it was highly inappropriate and embarrassing. Id like to think that you will address this immediately. Velma told me that her next tour will be April 26 at 3:00 p.m., and she is very concerned that this issue be addressed by then. Please make sure that your team members understand how important it is to act professionally around customers. And this should also extend to keeping their work areas cleanVelma mentioned that there were some areas around Trim Install that were littered with bits of plastic and empty food wrappers.  Thanks. Alex  Alex Norman Manager, Sales",NA,"Shea, Please carry on . I think you will manage well. Cory , Shea, Could you please set up a talk session on the job rotation program like you have arranged for the SEQUENCE after consulting Mr. Howard on his availability. I have already asked Jamie and Sam to prepare a job rotation roster amongst their dept and submit it to Mr. Howard. Thnks Cory","Hi Jennifer, Hope you must have seen my mail to my guys. I think that once the SEQUENCE program is explained to everyone and the implementation begins, you will find great improvement in the rework reduction. On the absenteesm aspect, I would need to get into once I am back . In the mean time Jamie and Sam would be trying to sort it out at their level. Thanks Cory ,",NA,"Hi J.J. I am very pleased with your initiative on this changes and I think this is what ourSEQUENCE program is all about. Remind me to ask someone to reward on this one. One word of advice regarding taking away company data. As you know , we are in a very competitive market and cannot afford to lose ground to our competitors.Security people were askng about your activities regarding carrying data away from the company premises. I have made them understand your position but henceforth I am putting down this rule that no one would carrying away any company related data from the premises. What ever research is required to be done should be done on the premises and would be a little incovenient but necessary looking to the security angle . I think this restriction should not stop an intelligent guy like you from getting new bright ideas. Thanks Cory nt: 4/5/2016 11:25 AM To: Manning, Cory Cc: Subject : Turntable Proposal Hi Cory,  We are pretty close to the end of the SmartChanges process and were confident that we have found a way to speed up trim installation. The main change is to attach the frame of a NoiseBreaker to a kind of turntable which would rotate around as the team members installed the various pieces of trim. We think that it will save the team members a lot of walking around during the installation process. We hoped to include Carson Spilkes, but he was too busy. So, the main people working on it were me, Paul Bern, and Emily Carson. We produced a draft design that should be simple to manufacture.  I led the research by pulling a lot of data and working on it at home to make sure that our calculations were correct. I take a statistics class in the evenings and I thought that my classmates might also be able to add some insight. My professor and fellow students helped me to look more closely at some recent SEQUENCE data and how our current process has affected efficiency. We all concluded there was room for improvement.  Anyway, I know that Paul found a supplier that can manufacture the turntable and he also found some money in the budget to get the unit built and installed. Pauls research indicates that the turntable will take two months to build and ship, and another week to install.  I know youre busy today, so Ill plan on calling Barrett Remini today to place our order with the supplier. If you want any details, set up an appointment with me for when you return and we can go over it.  Thanks!  J.J. J.J. Paxton Lead, Trim Install,","Hi Isaac, I am sorry I wouldn't be around when you would be putting in the new system, but I have already informed Sam and Jamie to extend you al their help in the process.

Regards, Jamie","1)I handled them in the order they were recieved but only because of the time limit. I read the message, determined what had to be done, if i promised to contact someone, i did. Then if I scheduled something, I emailed Shea to put it on the calandar. 2) Change (Implementing SEQUENCE), Training, focus, quality. 3) Change: because it's difficult for most people to handle, especially if they have worked a certain way for a long time.  Training: Some of the problems could be that the workers don't know how to do something properly because they weren't trained.  Focus: Some of the problems made workers focus on other people instead of the work they ahould be doing. When they weren't focused it caused more errors, which caused more repair work, which causes less product to go out the door.Original Message----- From: Assessment Administrator Sent: 4/5/2016 11:31 AM To: Pace, Jamie Cc: Subject : About your day (1 of 2)  This e-mail and the one that follows contain some final questions for you.

WHen you say 'informally mentoring"" what do you mean by that exactly? Did you take it upon yourself to mentor Mr. Winters? If you can give me a little more background in regards to finding a new coordinator. If we are trying to find a candidate to fill an additional coordinator position, the candidate will have to go through a formal selection process, including submitting a resume, filling out the application, and being interviewed. SInce Mr. Winters has not been through this formal process, it is not appropriate to have him ""fill in"" for you while you are out. I expect that with you going on vacation that you should complete the tasks you need to complete and have one of your coordinator colleagues be available to your clients in your absence.

I would like to wait and see if the feedback I gave her today assists her in improving and see if there is an increase in her customer service rating. In the meantime thought to help develop this employee, we could get her enrolled in the CS2BASIC, CS2IM, and CS2LSIS classes, so that next time there is an opening, if her scores have improved she would be ready to move up.

We will need to investigate this further and talk to the executives about it due to the severity of what may have happened. We need to figure out how we should handle this matter.

Your answers to these questions will help us evaluate your performance by giving us a better understanding of your approach to the challenges you faced. It is therefore very important that you provide complete and thorough answers to the questions below and on the e-mail that follows.  To reply to the questions in these messages, simply click the Reply button above and enter your responses in the form of a reply e-mail.  1. Did you handle each challenge in the order you received it, or did you handle them another way? Please describe your approach. My approach was toprioritize items as immediate, important,or routine and respond to them accordingly. I would then switch to meeting-prep followed by meetings as required,holding unfinisheditems and returning to them when I had time. In practice, this took a little bit of time to adjust to and soI felt constantly behind. Internet connection issues didn't help either!  2. Please list the major categories of issues or problems facing Final Assembly in the Bridgeport facility of Soundproof Solutions. I see three major categories, though some are inter-related: Personnel issues Technical issues Business issues  3. Describe why each entry in Question 2 is an issue or problem. Personnel issues such as sexualharassment,lack of professionalism, poor attendance, low morale, breach of confidentiality, poor conduct can severely impede productivity and morale and even makethe workplace a harmful or hostile environment. Technical issues such as improper processes, lack of following processes, ineffective methodologies, and/or poor intra-team comunication can result in manufacturing inefficiency, downtime, reduced output, excessive cost,and unreliable product. Business issues such as competition, turn-over, projecting product-negativity,and confidentiality-breaches can also drastically affect the bottom-line.  1. What were the three most important and the three least important e-mails to handle? Most important issues: 1 Theft of company information: J.J. Paxton is suspected of stealing company-confidential information: immediate response 2 Professional conduct: Salesperson unnerved by team member behavior during customer tour 3 Turntable proposal: New turntable design for trim install: needed to respond to propose schedule change Least important: 1 Victory lunch: Al and Paul will buy lunch for the group leader with better performance survey results 2 Suggestion box: Proposal for an incentive plan to increase team members suggestions 3 Job rotation: Suggestion that team members rotate jobs to minimize boredom and errors 2. Why did you feel that the e-mails you rated as most important were critical? Theft of company information is a very serious offense and requires immediate action. I felt that escalation to my supervisor was the correct response. Professional conduct has wide-reaching influence to the corporate culture and must also be dealt with immedately. Since identities were unclear, I chose a generalized approach (training) to this rather than individual-counseling. Upgrades to robot software seemed a large-scale change and I was unsure about how carefully it was considered. My response was to move the schedule out pending evaluation.Original Message----- From: Assessment Administrator Sent: 4/5/2016 1:36 PM To: Pace, Jamie Cc: Subject : About your day (2 of 2)  Following are some of the e-mails that you received today, along with some questions about how you approached them.

We need to be thinking of ways to involve your 'new' team members with your current team, and work with training to ensure that everyone is brought up to speed in a timely fashion, and to ensure quality doesn't falter. Emily Carson can work with you to handle the management of SEQUENCE training for the newer folks from Kirkland. Let me know your plan and get with Emily, and we'll discuss when I return. Thanks, Jamie",NA,NA,NA,"Shea, Please choose the appropriate room for the size of the group and put out a notice that this will take place on April 21. Please work with Al to be sure the needs of the group are met. Thanks, Jamie",NA,NA,"JJ, Please hold on this trim/turntable issue until we get the speaker covering issue taken care of that I mentioned in an earlier email. We can discuss this further when I return or we can work through Cory if this is time sensitive. Please let me know and cc Cory if this needs attention sooner. I'd also like to hear about your classes input when we have more time to discuss. Thank you. Jamie",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Vic, I understand your concerns with JJ, but we'll need to work with HR on this problem and see if we can resolve it. JJ may have a perfectly legitimate reason for taking information home. Karen can help us work through the issue and interview JJ to see where it takes us. We can't act prematurely until we have all the facts. I am busy today but this is important. I'd like to have Cory involved as well. This could be serious as you stated. I'll try to have Shea Foster look at everyone's schedules to see if we all have time for a meeting yet today.

Did you handle each challenge in the order you received it, or did you handle them another way? Please describe your approach. I tried to triage the challenges based on urgency, and who they came from (the boss). I revisited the inbox often to be sure each was addressed.   2. Please list the major categories of issues or problems facing Final Assembly in the Bridgeport facility of Soundproof Solutions. Morale, training, communication, lack of understanding  3. Describe why each entry in Question 2 is an issue or problem. Morale - lowered production and caused absenteeism  Communication - between group leaders was lacking. Little cooperation meant lower productivity and hurt feelings.  Lack of understanding - cross training was needed. People were in a rut and this hurt production.Understanding other's jobs helps with the overall process ofselling noise reduction equipment.

Your answers to these questions will help us evaluate your performance by giving us a better understanding of your approach to the challenges you faced. To respond, simply click the Reply button above and enter your answers in the form of a reply e-mail.   Turntable proposal: New turntable design for trim install not an immediate issue to deal with and needed further discussion  Victory lunch: Al and Paul will buy lunch for the group leader with better performance survey results I didn't agree with the competition approach but supported it since it was already in place and done with.  Interaction you saw earlier today: Larry Hodges and Emily Carson disagree about SEQUENCE I don't recall this interaction. Missed one!  Debby Britzki: Request to move a team member with performance problems to another team This is just moving a problem of JJ's and he had several items that needed to be discussed in a clump. He's a time eater and needs some assistance at work.  Kirkland plant: Concern about team members transferring from an older plant - see above and JJ concerns.  Team focus: Data indicate higher error rates when the team lead cant support the group - bigger problem that needed more discussion and in person. Saved that for a lunch and another day.  Upgrades to robot software: IT proposes software rollout plan - Beyond me and had to leave it to the experts. We'll need to work around those issues on the plant floor.  Professional conduct: Salesperson unnerved by team member behavior during customer tour - Addressed with the leaders to deal with their groups individually. Not all teams had issues.  SEQUENCE talk: Workers grumbling over extra effort without extra pay under SEQUENCE - Common problem with new programs and processes. Have to sell it as a positive to the workers and hopefully my level believes it as well.  Corporate audit: Request to prepare department for corporate review of operations  Suggestion box: Proposal for an incentive plan to increase team members suggestions  Warranty claim: Request for a plan to investigate warranty claims for a customers new units  Job rotation: Suggestion that team members rotate jobs to minimize boredom and errors  Theft of company information: J.J. Paxton is suspected of stealing company-confidential information   1. What were the three most important and the three least important e-mails to handle? Most important: The ones from the boss asking for action on items with response that same day with a path forward. Least would be JJ Paxton's concerns. They need to be addressed but not today. They can wait until after vacation. They need long term fixes..........if he's still here when Jamie gets back!   2. Why did you feel that the e-mails you rated as most important were critical? They came from one of the higher-ups and they have their finger on the pulse of what needs to be done for the company. They were truly trying to help Jamie in the first day.   3.Todays assessment provided you with background information about Soundproof Solutions and also presented thechallenging messages listed above. Were there situations where information from one source/challenge helped you to better understand and address anotherchallenge? If so, please list specific examples of theseinstances (Example: Message X related to Message Z, Company Policies related to Message Y, etc.). Yes the more information the better. Those background emails about the phone calls really helped. Sometimes the dis-jointed manner in which they arrived didn't work well with my system of managing email."

Describe why each entry in Question 2 is an issue or problem. Employee Morale is an issue as these are the individuals who are the back bone of the company. If you do not have employee buy in the SEQUENCE program will be a failure tarnishing company repuatation and most likely causing profit loss, product quality issues, etc. Communication is also a concern as it seemed there is still a lot of questions regarding the SEQUENCE process. There is seems to be confusion between the work groups which could lead to employees taking risks. Also, there seemed to be tension between employees and groups of the organization.

In the meantime, could you please spend extra time reviewing Line 1's instalations - particuliarly when we have a sickness or part of the normal crew out? Please let me know if you what you see in my absense. Thanks, Jaime ,",NA,"JJ, Great progress on this SmartChange process. I have some concerns that engineering (Carson Spikes) wasn't involved in the design process and some other questions I'd like answered before we proceed with this order. Please put the order on hold at this time. While I'm next week can you please attempt to coordinate with Carson Spikes - I'll call him and ask that he makes time for you. Thanks, Jaime , Hey Karen, Please read the note below. My two concerns are that JJ is spending additional time at home working and that he is sharing some potentinial private information with non-employees. Can you please guide me in the best way to handle this? Thanks, Jaime","Isaac, Thank you. The plan looks great, but I would like to delay for 1 week (Install on the 22nd and begin using on the 25th). I will be out of town and we have a very busy week the 18th - 22nd. I'd also like to meet with on the 22nd to make sure we have the plans for this process ironed out - does 1:00pm work for you? Thanks, Jamie ,",NA,NA,NA,",","This e-mail and the one that follows contain some final questions for you. Your answers to these questions will help us evaluate your performance by giving us a better understanding of your approach to the challenges you faced. It is therefore very important that you provide complete and thorough answers to the questions below and on the e-mail that follows.  To reply to the questions in these messages, simply click the Reply button above and enter your responses in the form of a reply e-mail.  1. Did you handle each challenge in the order you received it, or did you handle them another way? Please describe your approach. I tried to handle them as I received them while balancing around phone calls. I read them as they came in, and if some items I hadn't already responded to affected the same people, Igroup my responses.I wasn't sure how much time was going tobe alotted withoutnew incoming items - so my approach was to get as much done as quickly and thoroughly as possible.  2. Please list the major categories of issues or problems facing Final Assembly in the Bridgeport facility of Soundproof Solutions. Final Assembly is havingsome issues buying into the SEQUENCE initiative at all levels. A lot of being demanded of theTeam Leads andproductivity is being affected.  3. Describe why each entry in Question 2 is an issue or problem. Most every communicationdealt in some way with SEQUENCE and employee buy-in.Most major changesinvoke this kind of reaction and it is important for management to involve the employees and make them feel like it is their own process. Currently, Electronics is behind on training, Trim has had many issues product quality, and Robin has complained about being over-worked.This lends me to believe that we are relying heavily on our Team Leadsif we3/3 on issues at that level.  Following are some of the e-mails that you received today, along with some questions about how you approached them. Your answers to these questions will help us evaluate your performance by giving us a better understanding of your approach to the challenges you faced. To respond, simply click the Reply button above and enter your answers in the form of a reply e-mail.   Turntable proposal: New turntable design for trim install - I felt the turntable was being pushed to fast - it needed to be reviewed by engineering and have more buy-in.  Victory lunch: Al and Paul will buy lunch for the group leader with better performance survey results This sort of 'victory lunch' helps create competition, but may also damage the team atmosphere - since it requires a winner AND a loser. I felt rewarding both people with lunch served as a better job well done.  Interaction you saw earlier today: Larry Hodges and Emily Carson disagree about SEQUENCE I decided to handle talking with both employees individually - in a general way. Instead of brining up this particular incident, i thought it best to discuss w/ Larry the importance of buying in to SEQUENCE and his value as a senior employee. I setup a discussion with Emily about how to handle big changes and the difficulties dealing with them.  Debby Britzki: Request to move a team member with performance problems to another team Kirkland plant: Concern about team members transferring from an older plant Team focus: Data indicate higher error rates when the team lead cant support the group I combined the above 3 items into one meeting note for JJ since they were all in his group. I feel like JJ may be a bit over worked and some of his frustrations may be displaced. Looking at the Team Focus data, it appears that most errors occur when JJ is in an operations role instead of support. I needed to investigate to find out if it was JJ's errors on the line or his inability to fix other's errors since he couldn't oversee. I planned to discuss Kirkland and Debby to find out the real story during the meeting as well.  Upgrades to robot software: IT proposes software rollout plan Planned to push back a week until I was back from vacation and could help oversee.  Professional conduct: Salesperson unnerved by team member behavior during customer tour Wanted to put out a groupwide e-mail to discuss proper behavior that could be referenced if any situations arose during the next tour. Since most of the accusations were heresay, I did nothing to address them currently.  SEQUENCE talk: Workers grumbling over extra effort without extra pay under SEQUENCE Sent out a group messsage to let everyone know the importance of SEQUENCE to our company.  Corporate audit: Request to prepare department for corporate review of operations Messaged Team Leads to advise them to prepare their areas for auditors. Moved group meeting to better accomidate audit and allow me to be present for next group meeting.  Suggestion box: Proposal for an incentive plan to increase team members suggestions Went with my bosses suggestions and worked through my leads to implement. I felt his ideas were good and straight forward and not much change was needed.  Warranty claim: Request for a plan to investigate warranty claims for a customers new units Setup a team to investigate and included the lead and PQ person. I wanted a sound solution to present to Doxy as this was one of our major issues.  Job rotation: Suggestion that team members rotate jobs to minimize boredom and errors I felt we needed to improve our current positions and with the SEQUENCE changes in the middle of roll-out, I suggested delaying to prevent worker confusion.  Theft of company information: J.J. Paxton is suspected of stealing company-confidential information Had a meeting setup. Per JJ's emails, I didn't feel like he was stealing but was violating company policy. I contacted HR to find a best practice in handling the situation.   1. What were the three most important and the three least important e-mails to handle? MOST: Theft of company information: J.J. Paxton is suspected of stealing company-confidential information Warranty claim: Request for a plan to investigate warranty claims for a customers new units SEQUENCE talk: Workers grumbling over extra effort without extra pay under SEQUENCE LEAST: Debby Britzki: Request to move a team member with performance problems to another team Kirkland plant: Concern about team members transferring from an older plant Victory lunch: Al and Paul will buy lunch for the group leader with better performance survey results  2. Why did you feel that the e-mails you rated as most important were critical? Theft of company information: J.J. Paxton is suspected of stealing company-confidential information- If not responded to, could ofcreated a serious HR issue. Warranty claim: Request for a plan to investigate warranty claims for a customers new units - Product Qualityand customer issues are a serious concern - meeting with apotential largevolume customerand having good answers is very important. SEQUENCE talk: Workers grumbling over extra effort without extra pay under SEQUENCE- the company is pushing SEQUENCE and having our area in line is very important to company success.   3.Todays assessment provided you with background information about Soundproof Solutions and also presented thechallenging messages listed above. Were there situations where information from one source/challenge helped you to better understand and address anotherchallenge? If so, please list specific examples of theseinstances (Example: Message X related to Message Z, Company Policies related to Message Y, etc.). Being able to re-reference the material was very important. One complaint, is that all people you reference in this simulation should be findable on the Org Chart."

This might not be today but I would like to get with you and get a quick run down on the company's policies. Thanks","JJ, I appreciate your proactiveness. Your point is well taken. However, it's probably best to discuss our selection criteria with HR. I hate to violate any labor laws in the process of choosing best workers. Do you know when is this transfer is going to happen?

I know this maybe a difficult task, but due to time restraints, I'm going to count on you to convey to the team that we need to polish our image and well represent Soundproof Solutions. Thanks Jamie",NA,"Shea, thanks for the heads up. I'm all for these type of meetings, and I'm sure the team feels the same way. Seems like Lunch time is better suited for the type of meeting. Room BP07 would fit my entire team. Thanks again Jamie ,",NA,NA,"JJ, looks like you've put a lot of effort into this project. I like the use of other resources (night class student) to verify your design. I would like to take a look at this first before we move forward and place an order.

Thanks Jamie ,",NA,NA,NA,"Karen, I just left a voice mail to Vic instructing him to get ahold of you and I to further discuss this matter.

I wish that i could tell you that we could pick all the good team members for our selves, but if we get all the skill on our line where does that leave the other lines? We have to think about the plant as a whole not just our line. I will do the best i can to make sure we do get some members that will easily adapt to our difference in technology, but it simply wouldnt be fair to the other lines if we got all of the skilled members.

I was hoping you would have a chance to meet later today. If possible please send me a time that works for you between 2 and 3pm. I would like to discuss with you some first impressions I have received regarding my staff and Emily. I am planning on meeting with a couple of people from my team today, but I think it would be wise for me to touch base with you first. It is regarding the working relationship with a couple of my team and Emily. As per the attachement you sent me on trim repairs. I would also add quickly that as I glance at the Trim Repairs the trend I see is a spike when J.J. is working. I would like to pursue that issue and see what the cause might be. Although it seems related to JJ working, it may not be JJ's work specifically but the fact that he is filling in may be leaving something else he normally does that protects for such repairs being needed. Regarding t Thank-you, From: Lake, Jennifer Sent: 4/5/2016 9:20 AM To: Manning, Cory Cc: Subject : Team Focus Hi Cory,  I wanted to draw your attention to a troubling trend that Im seeing. I think that your team is losing focus. I reviewed Line 1s Trim Install repairs for March and found that your team had several days with excessive repairs. Im sure youre aware how time-consuming repairs can negatively impact our SEQUENCE results.  I am attaching some information that you might find helpful. I have combined my teams summary of Marchs Trim Install Repairs for Group A along with an Absence Report that Karen Duvalier provided. Its not unusual for one or two people to be sick or absent on any given day. We find substitutions and carry on with production; however, its clear to me that when Larry isnt on the line, errors go up.  Overall, your team really struggled with repairs in March. I suppose Paul was more interested in preparing for his new assignment than he was about overseeing the teams activities.  Please review the attached information. If there is any way for me to assist in reducing repair rates for April, please let me know.  Thanks, Jennifer  Jennifer Lake Manager, Quality Processes  Attachment",NA,"J.J.

My normal course of action when faced with multiple emails is to open the ones from my manager first, then open them in the order in which I received them. In today's case that varied slightly. In the beginning of the day I was trying to prepare for my first meeting of the day. That meant I was focused on discerning which emails would be relevent to building an appropriate agenda for the meeting with Jamie Pace. As it turned out that was not necessary as the agenda came in the minutes preceding the meeting. Normally I would try to handle each email as it arrived, unless a pressing meeting dicated otherwise.  2. Please list the major categories of issues or problems facing Final Assembly in the Bridgeport facility ofSoundproof Solutions. There are some significant engagement issues.I sense the general workforce has not bought into Sequence. There are also indicators thatpoint to unhappy workers. I sense this is leading to thepoor quality numbers and potentiallyhigh absents reported. There are a few personal conflicts that need to be workedout ASAP. There are problems with quality. I believe these may tie directly back to engagement. 3. Describe why each entry in Question 2 is an issue or problem.

The three most important where warrenty claim, proffesional conduct, and Team focus because these effect the ability of our company to put a good quallity product out the door. Employees need to understand that without a product of good quality there is no company. The least important were upgrades to software, turntable, job rotation.

Regards, Jamie","Hello Isaac - Ilook forward to meeting you as well. The changes regarding the robot programming software sound exciting, but I do have some concerns over the implementation schedule. - I really think the teams should get some training on the software before it's implemented, not after. - I think the old software should still be available as a backup in case anything goes wrong. - I would appreciate if someone from your team was available on site to handle any issues with implementation - to keep the line down for as short as possible. How will we know what the status of the implementation is? What is the plan if problems arise? Who is our contact person? In order to keep to the same general timeframe for implementation, I would propose the following schedule instead: April 13-15: IT training on softwarewith the team leader and members April 18: Software is loaded on tools. Your IT group is on site to assist in install. Please keep old software accessible in case of problems. April 19-22: Software is used by teams, some IT support onsite. Teams leaders report issues directly to you. April 25-29:IT to make any software corrections required May 2: We will officially roll out the new software for your team to use. May 2-6: Follow up Cory - has the line down time been scheduled?Has the training time to learn new software been allocated? What about software fix time?

Some required answers immediately (don't order turntable equipment, don't fire JJ). Others I felt could be answered throughout the day. 2 - In order of importance, SEQUENCE is not seen as value-added, interpersonal conflict, people are not engaged. 3 - In order from 2, SEQUENCE is what the company is preaching at the highest level, yet the line members don't see it's use. Much infighting / disregard for other employees.

By no means am I dismissing this issue, but I just want to make sure that we have tried to remedy the situation as best that we can before we escalate the issue on up the line. If you have little success, then I will surly assess her myself and help the Team accordingly. Frankly, she just may need shown a more efficient and correct way to install the Trim, or, she may just need to feel as a part of a Team rather than the ""outcast"" that other Teams have made her to feel (which brings up whole other issues).

Though errors that lead to repairs do seem to spike when Larry is off from work; it actually appears that the bigger issue is the number of sick days assessed to the Trim Install Team for the month, which may be leading to JJ Paxton being spread too thin, or perhaps, he may need to better understand the install processes.

It so happens JJ Paxton was working on a project (Turntable - see email attached to bottom of page) at home. I cautioned him on how to use outside sources when getting data analyized.

Did you handle each challenge in the order you received it, or did you handle them another way? Please describe your approach. I handledeach in the order it was received except at the very end when I was crunched for time. I would scan the headers to see if there was a thread emails pertaining to one subject. Future emails would touch on subjects already emailed about and provide additionalinformation or previouscommunications could be used to support decisions on the current email.  2. Please list the major categories of issues or problems facing Final Assembly in the Bridgeport facility of Soundproof Solutions. Conflictbetween older experienced individuals and new individuals. Trim had issues with personel acting out and have ""trash"" in the work area. Poor communication between areas  3. Describe why each entry in Question 2 is an issue or problem. Conflect between olderand newer individualswas seen in Emily and Larry. This can cause bad morale and ultimately HR issues if someone gets written up or fired. I think the trick is to get them to work together some how. Trim was called out in Alex's tour email and some of the behavor was seen between Emily and Larry. Poor communication between the group building the amps and the group installing them. A change was made by the amp assembly group and the group installing did not know it was coming. they saw a change and did not know why it was happening so scrapped the units instead of talking to the other group.  1: three most important: Warranty claim Theft of company information Interaction you saw earlier today three least important Kirkland plant Debby Britzki: Victory lunch: 2: I put the warranty claim in the top three because typically there is a time limit to get back to the customer and these claims need to be taken care of quickly to ensure a company is still not making substandard products. I put theft of compnay information and the interaction you saw earlier today in the top three as well. In both instances it had the potential to get someone terminated. In the case of the theft of company information it was a missunderstanding since the person was working on a project at home. The emily-larry interaction could quickly escalate into one or the other being written up or fired. 3. there was a lot of messages to crossed and corresponded with each other.

As a supporter of SEQUENCE, I am sure you will appreciate the need of training and retraining of people and that is one thing we need to do constantly. I would rather have you say that, I do not have any particular choice, whosoever we bring, we shall bring the necessary gamut and atmosphere of learning so that each new member also will get into the groove.

The main change is to attach the frame of a NoiseBreaker to a kind of turntable which would rotate around as the team members installed the various pieces of trim. We think that it will save the team members a lot of walking around during the installation process. We hoped to include Carson Spilkes, but he was too busy. So, the main people working on it were me, Paul Bern, and Emily Carson. We produced a draft design that should be simple to manufacture.  I led the research by pulling a lot of data and working on it at home to make sure that our calculations were correct. I take a statistics class in the evenings and I thought that my classmates might also be able to add some insight. My professor and fellow students helped me to look more closely at some recent SEQUENCE data and how our current process has affected efficiency. We all concluded there was room for improvement.  Anyway, I know that Paul found a supplier that can manufacture the turntable and he also found some money in the budget to get the unit built and installed. Pauls research indicates that the turntable will take two months to build and ship, and another week to install.  I know youre busy today, so Ill plan on calling Barrett Remini today to place our order with the supplier. If you want any details, set up an appointment with me for when you return and we can go over it.  Thanks!  J.J. J.J. Paxton Lead, Trim Install",NA,NA,"dear jammie, congratulation to you and both of your team member on this success.

The Krikland plant is very old and these people were working with it since it opened even when there is no SEQUENCE or new tech. is adopted. You apprehension is true some way.

Regards, Cory From: Norman, Alex Sent: 4/5/2016 10:30 AM To: Manning, Cory Cc: Subject : Professional Conduct Hi,  You should know that salespeople assigned to our region occasionally use the Bridgeport plant to hold tours for potential customers. Its a good opportunity for the salespeople to show our advanced manufacturing techniques. Unfortunately, we ran into a problem last week when Velma Miller brought in representatives from a major potential account. As she led them past the Trim Install break area, she could overhear two team members making fun of SEQUENCE. They were having a good time making up silly things to be measured against, then taking turns disciplining each other for being very far off their goals. Velma thinks they were Larry Hodges and Harry Vitz.  At another point in the tour, one of the guests, who was apparently quite attractive, mentioned to Velma how much she appreciated the opportunity to see our people work as they built the NoiseBreakers. Velma heard someone whistle and one of the team members say, You can watch me work anytime. It was probably Keith Baggus, as hes been known to make similar comments.  Velma wasnt sure if any of the customers heard that, but she thought it was highly inappropriate and embarrassing. Id like to think that you will address this immediately. Velma told me that her next tour will be April 26 at 3:00 p.m., and she is very concerned that this issue be addressed by then. Please make sure that your team members understand how important it is to act professionally around customers. And this should also extend to keeping their work areas cleanVelma mentioned that there were some areas around Trim Install that were littered with bits of plastic and empty food wrappers.  Thanks. Alex  Alex Norman Manager, Sales",NA,"Hi Shea, 5 to 6 p.m would be the suitable time. May book conference room BP07. Cory","Dear Jennifer, Thnaks for providing March's Trim install repair summary report. From the report it is clear that most of the repairs were occured when J.J Paxton was deputed as substitute for absentee. I think J.J Paxton is not as trained as others are. In my opinion J.J Paxton need some training. I shall discuss this with Howard and will take corrective action suitably. Cory",NA,"Dear Paxton, Your proposal sound interesting. I want to go through it. Please see me today. I want to understand your design before going to leave. Cory",NA,NA,"Dear Pace, I have gone through the assessment survey done by you on Pat & J.J. It is quite interesting. Both are have some strong points. J.J has good knowledge of work, traced out problems easily due to good knowledge of product line, he considers problems carefully before responding on it. Pat gives inspiration to others, treat all group members fairly. But Pat has some ve points also, like he do not discuss with others before giving decisions, blames more on people rather than situation, goes beyond limit of his own authority. Pat has to avoid all this. From my point of view J.J should be the winner. Regards, Cory",NA,"Daisha, First we should invesitigate the issue before concluding on result.

In my opinion, one should be fair in declaring the results to keep spirit of the game alive. Looking to the scores, its clear that on all the fronts, pertaining towhich are necessary for a good team leader, Pat has scored better. Hence, by humbly defining the criterion, we should declare him as winner. I hope, JJ shall also understand the spirit of the game and shall accept it. Thanks, Cory.",NA,"Dear Sir, Thanks for the updates. I am really surprised to know the incident. I am of the opinion that if we find anybody working against the ethics / moral / values of company should immediately be debarred.

dwvYSNidmna,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"JJ, I appreciate your concern about the performance of the team members. I think that rather that moving an employee with variable performance to another group to deal with, we should work on the issues so that we can get consistent, top-notch performance from her on this team. I'd like for you to take the opportunity to work with her personally as Team Leader when she seems to be having a bad day and rework rates are high. Deliver additional training if necessary or offer troubleshooting help. If we can engage her in her job and show her that we care, the performance will go up and tardy and absentee rates should drop as well.

It is large enough to accommodate the entire group, and it also has round tables to encourage discussion, a projector and screen for Al's presentation, and a flip chart to take down new ideas. I'd like for the meeting to be held at 7am so that we can maximize participation because everyone is alert and not just eager to get home. Thanks for bringing up the concerns you heard from Paul. It is good to know how the team feels about this new initiative. Thanks, Jamie ,","Jennifer, I agree there is a problem with the high repair rates on some days, however Ilooked at the data you sent and came up with a different conclusion. I think the root of the issue isn't that Larry is out, it's that JJ is filling in. The days where he is substituting for any team member have higher repair rates. I'd like to talk to JJ to find out what could be causing his performance issues. I have a meeting with him when I return from vacation regardinga project for SmartChanges, but that will be too late to improve April numbers. Would you be able to step in and have a discussion with him while I am out? The sooneryou meet, the better the impact will be this month.  I have a few ideas on what could be the problem, you can bring up these talking points in your meeting. Based on some recent communication with him, I think he has become preoccupied with individual team members and is not paying attention to his own performance. This may be affecting his focus and he could be letting defective parts through the line. He may need to be reminded of his duties as Team Leader (troubleshooting, training, etc.) instead of trying to manage the team. He seems to be very interested in his SmartChanges project, working on it at home and taking continuing education classes. He may bebecoming less engaged in his current role and want to advance. I'd like to find out if heis looking for newcareer opportunities or experiences. I appreciate your help, Jennifer, and that you brought this to my attention. I'd really like to see better numbers this month as well. Let's meet when I get back to talk about what you found out during your meeting with JJ. Thanks, Jamie ,",NA,"J.J., It sounds like you have put a lot of effort into this project. I would be happy to meet with you when I return from vacation. I've set up an appointment for Thursday, April 21st at 2:00pm, please stop by my office at this time and we can talk about the project installation. I'd like for you to go ahead and place the order today due to the long lead time, but please send me the design and supplier information so I can review in the meantime. Thanks, Jamie ,","Issac, Thanks for giving me a heads up on this software upgrade. I think it will promote troubleshooting within the team and also streamline our productivity. I have a question about the install. Since you will be taking the current system down, does this mean that none of the lines will be able to operate at all on Friday the 15th? Would your group be willing to do the install on Saturday since it is automated? This way we can avoid losing a day of production. Also, I'd like for you to set up some initial training on the software prior to use on April 18th, since this is new to the team and you will be removing the old software during the install. Thanks, Jamie , Team Leaders, I am forwarding an email to you from Issac Tecinov in IT regarding a software upgrade they will be rolling out. I've asked him to perform the install on Saturday the 16th so that we do not lose any productivity, since they will be taking our current system down to install the new software. Also, I've asked him to set up some training for your teams prior to the install so you can familiarize yourselves with the software before you have to use it. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns about this upgrade. Thanks, Jamie",NA,"Cory, Paul forwarded me his assessment survey on the cross-training done by Pat and JJ. Both performed very well and have obvious strengths. Although he indicates that Pat performed better, I looked at the scores and I disagree. Although Pat scored higher, some of the ""ideal"" scores are actually low and JJ rated better on those. More of his scores were closer to the ideal score and I am declaring him the winner. I will be setting up a meeting with each of them when I return to discuss their performance. Jamie ,",NA,"Vic, Please do not terminate JJ's employment without further investigation. In fact, JJ has been working on a project with Paul and Emily and he has committed a lot of his free time to doing so.

For the most part, I handled challenges in the order they came. I responded immediately to the ones with simple solutions and took more time to formulate responses for the more complicated or detailed challenges. 2. I thinkthe major issues are theSEQUENCE initiative and team performance. 3. If not all of the employees are on board with SEQUENCE, it will create discord among the group and the projects will not succeed. Some team members have not been following their job tasks and need to regain focus, as it is causing performance issues.Original Message----- From: Assessment Administrator Sent: 4/5/2016 12:31 PM To: Pace, Jamie Cc: Subject : About your day (1 of 2)  This e-mail and the one that follows contain some final questions for you.

I can see your frustration about this but I need to make sure I am looking at the problem from all the angles and I have all the adequate information before I make a decision like this.

Let meet and talk about it when I get back. I will be back April 20. Please schedule a meeting for me about this. In the mean time try to be patient with her and seek to understand what may be going on. For example, was she always like this or this is something new? She may be facing person problem and may need our help. Thank for your understating and let tackle this when I get back.

Since it seem like we do not hard evidence of the people involved in the incident it may be hard to take actions against a particular person. However, I will make my team know about the incident and the fact that this behavior is not acceptable and will be not be tolerated. I would also suggest you discuss this with plan manager so more comprehensive actions can be taken plant-wide.

Jamie",NA,"JJ  Thanks for the update and all the hard work you have put into this. It seems that you have embraced the SEQUENCE process. Since what it is been proposed is a big step, I would like to understand exactly where we are in the process and make sure all proper steps have been check out before we place the order. For example, Is this order of the turntable for a test implementation of the proposed solution or this step has already be done and validated (aka evaluate results step) and we are looking into standardize the solution? Unfortunately, I will be out of the office until April 20th and not available for discussion in the mean time but we can meet after I get back. So if you can provide me the information I need today, I will review it and give you the go ahead before I leave if everything check out. If we have something missing, then I will let you know and we can review the remaining information when I get back.

If this is true, we could really consider integrating your finding to our existing process. There were a couple of queries that come to mind though when I first saw the graphs and it is best that we clear these doubts before you proceed sending the graphs to Haley or pushing this idea to the team. As all statistics, I think it is crucial that the assumptions are clearly defined in your finding. For example, are the calls handled by the same representative, or are these calls made to the same customer? You could also consider plottingan additionalaccording to the types of conversation that occurs during these scheduling calls to see how the average call time for specific conversation-type affects the customer satisfaction scores as well. Additionally, I think you should work on a bigger set of data to further strengthenyour hypothesis. Why don't you work with a new set of 50 scheduling calls per week for the past 4 weekto replot the graphs? Since I will be away starting tomorrow, why don't you take the 2 weeks time that I will be away to work on this?We'll discuss about it when I am back in office and decide on the moving forward plan then.

First off, I hope you understand that the scores for the survey are not necessarily ""the-higher-the-better"". Out of the 11 statements,only 8 fits this context while a candidate should actually score lower score for the remaining 3 statements. You must understand that the ratings 1-7represent the opinions of whether the survey participants ""Strongly Disagree"" or ""Strongly Agree"" with the particular statement. Secondly, Jerry displays poor performance in topics that heshould have scored higher than the ideal score and vice versa for the case where he should have scored lower. Let me give you some examples: 1. In the event that he should ""treat everyone on the team fairly"" , ideal score is 5.8 buthe only scored 2.5. This means that the feedback is negative and the participants of the survey are not happy with the way Jerry has treated the teammates. 2. Jerry scored a whopping 6.6 in ""Usually blames problems on people rather than situation"" when the ideal score should be 2.3. This means that Jerry has not been professional in problem solutioning. Those are only 2 simple examples but I'm sure you would see the bigger picture once you read through the statements again. The scores just went the wrong way. However, I do not disagree with your suggestion to appoint Jerry as your replacement when you go on vacation on Thursday and Friday. Let's give him one more chance to prove his ability to take on the duties of a coordinator. However, before you go off, I hope you would have a pep talk with Jerry wrt to his scores on the performance survey. Work on his weaknesses and improve on his strengths. We'll take another survey next week and we shall see if he has improved hisself.

I will talk to my team about this and ensure that similar events will not happen again in the future. Best regards, Cary Stevens Leader Customer Support, Central District. /2016 11:15 AM To: Stevens, Cary Cc: Subject : Professional Conduct Cary,  You should know that salespeople assigned to our region occasionally use the office in your area to hold meetings with potential customers. Its a good opportunity for the salespeople to show that the company has a local presence, and arent just dealing with all customers from some distant central office. Unfortunately, we ran into a problem last week when Velma Miller brought in representatives from a major potential account. As she led them past your teams break area, she could overhear several of your team members making fun of someone theyd visited on a scheduling call. Apparently, the customers accent was difficult to understand, and the two representatives were having a fine time re-enacting the visit. Velma couldnt see the representatives, but Velma thought it was highly inappropriate and embarrassing.  Id like to think that you would address this incident immediately. Velma will be in town to hold additional meetings next week and is very concerned about being embarrassed by these two individuals. I am worried this is the work of Sloan and Eden. Please make sure they are under control so this doesnt happen again.  Thanks.  Alex  Alex Norman Manager, Central District Sales Soundproof Solutions","HiHaley, Good news indeed! I'mmore than happy thatI get to promote a staff on my first dayat job! Well, since it's my first day here, I have to be honest that my decision will be based on ratings I have in my record --ratings inherited from Barney. And I, sadly, say thatneither Blaine nor Eden made it into the list. Although their performanceand productivity indexes were impressive, the case isn'tthe same in the feedback receivedfromthe customers and peers. I'm not too comfortable with the inconsistencies. Indeed it was a hard decision to make and after some serious thinking, I have decided to promote Corey Thompson. Though his scores in the indexes are not the best-in-class, his ratings have been consistent and was not shabby -- 86% and 104% in performance and productivity index. Furthermore, he had received good grades from both customers and teammates. With an A+ gradingin teamwork, I'm sure he'll be able to improve his customers rating and better motivate the team to improve with him. Do let me know if you agree with my decision. Thank you. Best regards, Cary Stevens Leader Customer Support, Central District.",NA,NA,"Hi, Haley. I have decided to give the three training credits to the following reps for the respective trainings: 1. Chandan Kumar - CS2BASIC - Upon completion of this course, Chandan is then qualified to work at Level 2. His performance has been good thus far, portraying good teamwork and technical skills. Furthermore, he is a very enthusiastic person that many find comfortable to talk with. 2. Jamie Dubrovich - CS2LSIS - Upon completion of this course, Jamie is then qualified to work at Level 2. Jamie is very popular among co-workers and customers. He receives good ratings from customers in his customer service ratings in Jan-March 2016 with a grade-A. 3.Ashley Payne- CS2BASIC - Although she is just a TPT, she is showing good performance with her positive attitude on the job. Furthermore, she possesses solid understanding of processes in the company. It is beneficial to prep her to take on more important roles in the company. The nominees of Level 1 reps that are qualified to work at Level 2 are: 1. Tracy Hurdle 2. Chandan Kumar (upon completion of CS2BASIC course) 3.

Be clear on the products replaced and the reason for the customer to ask for the replacements. I will take this to Alex todecide on the actions that canbe taken on Weedlers. More importantly is how we can prevent Weedlers from acting this way again. Moving forward,please advise the CSRs to perform a check on the customer's recordsbefore a replacement is given. If the customer requests for a second product replacement, be sure to get the customer's agreement to return the defective product within 15 days. All shipping costs will be at our expense. Otherwise, no replacement unit will be sent to them. This is in line with our company policy on 'replacement of more products', although the multiple requests may have been done separately.

However, do you not think that your decision to escort Tracy out of the building and then get him terminated is a little drastic? Especially when there is no solid proof that Tracy is stealing company's information for the wrong purposes. How can you be so sure that Tracy was lying about him doing research in his off-time? I know it is your responsibility to safeguard the company's benefits, but I also hope that you do not act in rash. It was already wrong to go through Tracy's belongings when he went out for lunch. Thus, I do not want to see you repeating any mistakes here. I hope you understand my intention. Please give some time for me to talk to Tracy and find out the true story behind this.

Blaine is good in term of performance, but he need continous supervision. A good customer service, need to be act quickly, think fast,independent and able to make decision. Payne has solid understanding on the process and also excellent worker. As for this time, i think, payne will be the right candidates. Before we finalise the name, im suggest we conduct some interview with all three of them, do behavioral as well as functional assessment.This is very important for us to truely identify the strenght and weakness of each candidate and at the same time we can plan for their development. Thanks Cary",NA,NA,"Hi Haley,  Thanks for your email, i have read through all of the team's profile. Shortlisted name: 1. Jamie Dubrovich  In term of customer service,Jamie has very good relationship with customer and internal partners. This is one of the important criteria as a customer support. His lack of technical knowledge can be improve by having internal training, weekly knowledge check and quiz.  He is also very good in term of teamwork. Meaning, he should have no issue to get some help from other team member and learn from the senior. 2. Quinn labarre  Quinn score B+ in his customer rating. He is earnest and earger to please. I do believe, teamwork is very important in this kind of job profile. Quinn has a very good teamwork capability. 3. Chandar Kumar  Chandar is people oriented person. he is very comfortable when dealing with people and like to talk. His enthusuatism might help a lot to maintain his motivation while working under pressure. Another good things is, he is very good in technical problems. I do believe he can make fast decision and help customer to solve their issue. Some other suggestion: I hope we can conduct holistic development plan, covering all the critical aspect like customer service, teamwork and knowledge.

Whatever reason customer gave to us, we always need to verify. As for starting, you can table out all the fourteen orders together with the reason from customer, we need to see the pattern and all the possible scenarios before we make any assumption. As for next order, please sent out our team to do site verification for any similar scenarios. Maybe after this, we need to analyze all of our customers profile, order patterns, return/ exchange notes and cluster them according to the nature of business.

I also think Haley would be very interested in seeing the results, so go ahead and send them to her. Also, I support you in your meeting in the morning to get the other reps involved in this idea. In your coaching, be sure to promote the idea that it is not all about the timing of the call. We need to put emphasis on the customer experience and relationship. I do not want to lose focus on those two things. Thanks again for your insight and we can discuss more in our meeting today at 1:00. Thanks, Cary",NA,NA,"Taylor, I appreciate your enthusiasm on this. I also am impressed with Jerry's scores. There are a few scores in his results that are alarming to me. He seemed to score further from the ""Ideal Coordinator"" in areas revolving around Team Work. His scores were way off on things like ""treating everyone fairly"" and ""blaming problems on people"". I would ask you in your mentoring to look into these areas. About your request. I am excited that as a Coordinator you are looking for ways to motivate your senior reps. So, I am going to allow this fill in role. I do have someconcerns over Jerry's team work scores, but if you think he is ready I will agree to this. I will ask you to report to me how it went. I will also get some feedback from other senior reps. Thanks for having enthusiasm about this and have a nice vacation. Cary","Alex, First of all I want to let you know that I'm sorry about the conduct of my team. I assure you that I will address this stuation with the team as a whole. I want you to be confident that you can bring customers into our area at any time. Please insure Velma that this incident will not occur again. Thanks Cary","Haley, Thanks for the opportunity to promote someone to full time. I have made my choice and that person is Ashley Payne. My reasoning is this: Ashley has proven to be a very hard worker in her rol has a temporary rep. She has a solid understanding of all of our processes. Her Performance and Productivity Indexes are both very good. In looking at our Customer Service ratings she received a B+ which was the highes score of all our temps. On the Teamwork ratings she also received a B+. Along with all of this she has also started the Bench Strength training and has completed the CR2 Basic level. Blaine and Eden are both good workers and their indexes are solid. I will say that their ratings and the feedback left from Barney leaves me with some hesitation that they are ready to be full time reps. Please let me know if I need to add anymore reasoning. Thanks Cary",NA,NA,"Haley, I have reviewed this and I have some recommendations for the list. 1) Sandy Martin - Sandy has completed all the required training for the Level 2. She is very efficient and techinically savvy. I think she would be a very good Level 2. 2) Jamie Dubrovitch - Jamie only needs one more class which is the CR2LSIS. Jamie also has very solid scores on the customer service and team work ratings. She is very good with customers and with the extra training class I think she would be ready for the level 2. 3) Chandan Kumar - Chandan also only needs one more class, which is the CR2BASIC. Chandan has solid ratings scores and is good with technical issues. He is also good with the customers. With those 3 suggestions, that leave me with 1 training credit. I was wondering if I could be granted that credit to allow Jess Rollins to take a training class. Jess shows signs of having potential to be a level 2. I would like this credit to provider her with some motivation. Please let me know if you have questions about my recommendations. Thanks Cary",NA,NA,"Taylor, Thanks for the telling me about this. I appreciate you looking into the situation and taking it seriously. I would ask that you stop on collecting hand writing samples. This is not the way we should go about this. Since we do not know for sure who did this, I do not want us jumping to conclusions. I would like for you and Kim to handle this situation with the team as a whole. Address your team all together and tell the importance acting in a professional way. I will contact Jody to tell her we are addressing the situation. Please keep me in the loop on this issue. Cary",NA,"Taylor, Please hold off on the Weedler issue right now. I would like to set up a meeting with him, you, and Velma to discuss his account. I will set this meeting up for after I return. Thanks, Cary","Liang, Thanks for informing me of this. Please hold off before escorting Tracy out of the office of filing in paper work. I would like the chance to meet with Tracy and you about this issue. I will set up a meeting for later today. Thanks Cary","1.Customer satisfaction - there seemed to be a lot of meetings and schedule changes based around unhappy customers. The schedule was already full of projects. Employee motivation - there are several employees who are lacking motivation and it is effecting their work. Jess has not motivation, Sloan has a reputation as a goof off. Seems like there needs to be more oppotunites for the reps at both levels. Project Strategy - the database has issues, the schedule is packed, not enough installers. All of this impacts Team 5 through customer service 2.QuietPAPER One product and the Hilltop Hotel reinstall. This impacted the schedule and had to ramp up staff to work calls. Weedler Contracting - setting up this meeting quickly was essential. Want customer to be satisfied, but also wanted to notbe out more money if possible Employee Conduct - between the issue with Eluto and the break room banter, there are areas ofgreat concern inside the office. 3.I detected the correlation between the security guard suspecting Tracy of stealing data and her doing school research. Meetings had to be set up regarding the suspicion, but I also had to respond to her data findings. So, all had to be taken care of in some manner. 4.The information was fine. Tying all the pieces together was hard. Remembering to go back and look at performance reviews and Barney's evals were very helpeful. Which ties into a real world setting of knowing individuals and/or sitting in the same room with them when you speak. Which, also may not always happen."

Due to the amount of E-mails and time restraints/schedule I did not answer the questions in order. Rather I answered them by their title. I was trying to pick the ones that appeared to be priority by title. 2. Bridgeport is facing many issues currently, they have quality issues that are both in house and that have reached the customer. They have very low moral which can lead to some of the quality issues. They have poor communication between departments. They have a line leader who could potentially be getting fired. 3.Quality issues are huge for the company, they affect the appearance of the company by consumers and are very costly. The low moral among the members is a direct reflection on the management many times, so it can mean management issues such as someone having a diagreement or talking badly about another team in front of his or her team and that then passes along to the tm's moral. Poor moral can also affect quaility of work. Poor communications is not acceptable in this type of buisness at all, nothing good can come of poor communication.

I will be your contact in the Information Technology department. Anything to do with the programming of production machinery is handled exclusively by my team. Please let me know of any programming needs you have and I will do my best to satisfy them.  I have been talking with Al Howard about our new robot programming software. It should help make adjusting the robots and switching between programs much faster than before. Further, your team members will be able to make some adjustments to the robots directly, without involving Engineering or Maintenance. This will save both time and money, and has been approved by both Engineering and Maintenance. It is definitely very different from the current software in place. Al agreed that your group will be the test site for the entire company as we try to get the software finalized.  Here is the rollout plan I propose. Please note these dates.  Friday April 15: Install the software. We will need a full day to install and configure the software. The installation is automated, and will be done over the networkno one will need to go to your plant. However, we will need to take the current system down while we do this. We will remove your existing software at this time as well, since we are replacing it.  April 18-22: Your staff will use the software and report any issues to you. You will send the reports to me and I will act on them.  April 25-29: We will make changes to the software to correct problems found by your team.  May 2: We will officially roll out the new software for your team to use.  Week of May 2-6: We will train your team on using the software now that it is complete.  I talked this over with your team leaders and they had no concerns, but they asked that I take it up with you to confirm that we may go forward with this plan. Note that we are very flexible, so please get back to me by the end of the day with any changes you propose to make to this plan or schedule. However, Al wants to get moving within a week.

Your answers to these questions will help us evaluate your performance by giving us a better understanding of your approach to the challenges you faced. It is therefore very important that you provide complete and thorough answers to the questions below and on the e-mail that follows.  To reply to the questions in these messages, simply click the Reply button above and enter your responses in the form of a reply e-mail.  1. Did you handle each challenge in the order you received it, or did you handle them another way? Please describe your approach. Mostly yes. I tried to answer the emails based on the order I received it, but came across some that are not of high importance so I decided to skip them. I also based some replies on the sender, giving priority to my boss' email than feedback/s from others.  2. Please list the major categories of issues or problems facing Final Assembly in the Bridgeport facility of Soundproof Solutions. The major categories would include ""Reaction to Change"", ""People Differences"", ""Work Attitudes"" and ""Lack of feedback"".  3. Describe why each entry in Question 2 is an issue or problem. ""Reaction to Change"" - people from different levels, age bracket, work group respond differently to change. Some are willing to embrace it while others may think of it as unnecessary. This dictates how people would then respond to introduction of new policies or processes put into place by someone they think is not competent enough for the role. ""People Differences"" - People have different levels of intellect and may respond differently on every scenario. Some people have the patience to educate others, while others can treat these people as hindrances and therefore perform the actions by themselves. Thus, causing these people to be further left behind. ""Work Attitudes"" - How people behave at work was also a problem in Bridgeport. Others can set aside personal grievances and work professionally but others cannot hide the dismay they feel for a colleague. This was pointed out on several occasions where Emily was involved. People seemed to question her credibility for her position. Hence, resulting to people unwilling to accept the change. ""Lack of feedback"" - One thing I observed is that none of the SEQUENCE team actually reached out to the employees to solicit their inputs on the change in the process. I think it is important that they be involved having known the process for long periods of time.  Please see responses below.Original Message----- From: Assessment Administrator Sent: 4/5/2016 2:42 PM To: Pace, Jamie Cc: Subject : About your day (2 of 2) Following are some of the e-mails that you received today, along with some questions about how you approached them.

Why did you feel that the e-mails you rated as most important were critical? I considered those emails as critical because one of them involved termination of my direct report. The second was because my boss requests that I create a plan before I take my vacation. And the last one requires an action from me, in which I have to delegate because of my upcoming vacation.  3. Why did you feel that the e-mails you rated as least important were low priorities?  I felt these emails lack priorities because they are mostly ""For Your Information"" types only or based on opinions of the sender only. They did not require any immediate action from me."

It is important, however, to consider when looking at this information that more complex and difficult customer issues typically require more time to resolve effectively. With that said, I would rather you encourage your fellow representatives to take the necessary time to resolve customer issues and not be too worried with trying to make the call as quick as possible. I'm happy you decided to take an interest in Soundproof Solutions by using company data for your project. There is the potential, however, that sensitive information may be released unintentially.

Not only can he handle many calls but he also does so with very high efficiency! I'm a bit concerned that maybe Eden is rushing through her calls to get a high productivity index and may not be taking the required time to meet all of our customers' needs. Ashley Payne also looks like she would be a great choice as her numbers are both quite high.

Thanks, Ryan",NA,NA,"I will use 2 credits to advance Blaine into the vacant position that you posted. Tracy Hurdle and Sandy Martin on the short list as they have all courses done, which shows motivation. Dalas Bobco will get my last credit and be the 3rd person on the short list, because hisperformance index and productivity indexin pretty good and he has two courses completed.Quinn is showing a lot of motivation, but he still needs to gain more practical working experience. Thanks, Carey",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Hi Taylor, Thank you for bringing this to my attention. If Mr. Weedler does go ahead with next weeks' order please advise remind him that our return policy states we do not refund products that are damaged by installation that is done by others. I would also like for him to be told that if he finds another defect to please send it back to the company within 15 days so we can analyze the productand find any problems that may be accuring so he does not keep having this issue. A replacement rollis not to be sent again until we confirm the product to be defective. Please continue to process Mr. Weedler's orders as usual. As per our return policy, we will not ask Mr. Weedler to reimburse us for the previous rolls. If he calls again with this problem please have the issue escalated to me immediately. Thanks, Carey","Hi Liang, I would like the chance to speak with Tracy againbefore you take action, it is my understanding he was doing a school project and needed real life data. I have already warned him that any data taken needs my explicit permission. From what he told me it seems his intentions were pure, but his judgement was certainly misplaced. I will send an email to the team reminding them they are not to take information without my knowledge. Thanks, Carey Stevens Customer Support, Central District","1) There is a communication issue between installation and customer service reps. There seems to be a lack of understanding of each others roles and a lack of coordination. The warranty for commercial customer replacements is quite relaxed. Makes it easy to be abused. There is a lack of communication between Kim and her team. Jess Rollins' problems being the example At times reps have low patience or may lack the ability to troubleshoot problems customers are calling in about. Kendall Wilson had to go through three reps before being escalated. It should have been done as soon as she called the second time. 2)The promotion emails were very important. Haley needed a quick answer for a promotion and I made recommendations before I realized I was emailed more information about the candidates later on. This is very important because promotions shape the company's future. The email from the security guard was very important as someone was about to loose their job. Emails that prepared me for the meetings were important because I would not of been able to lead these meetings effectively otherwise. 3)Again, the emails that had employee information and emails from Haley about promotions were connected. Email between Tracy and security guard. 4) It was hard to understand the planing sheet for how many workers were needed for a job. It was unclear as to whether I needed to use customer service reps or installation persons. It was hard to organize my emails because there is no function to make them as ""unread"" once I opened them. It took a lot of time to find old emails because usually I would mark them as unopened again in my usual day on the job so I can find them easier. No info was given about how much our services cost, may not have been a big detail but could have helped in a phone call."

Please describe your approach. - Yes, I took notes on the issues that needs to be discussed in the meeting. I printed some of the materials that would serve as my reference. Although my first meeting didn't went well, I guess the next 2 was okay. During the discussion, I went straight to the point andI asked questions, I also gave suggestions and came to an agreement before closing the meeting. 2. Please list the major categories of issues or problems facing Final Assembly in the Bridgeport facility of Soundproof Solutions. - Communication - Teamwork - Planning  3. Describe why each entry in Question 2 is an issue or problem. - Communication - People are not well informed and there is no transparency. Might lead to no resolution of conflict at all. - Teamwork - People are not involved, others wants to do things on their own rather that helping each other - Planning -There should be a definite plan especially on the schedule of people.

Thanks again, Cary","Hi Haley, Exciting news to say the least. I can certainly understand that Eden's Productivity Score may show that she ""churns"" through a lot of work, but her Performance Score concerns me. Personally, i think there should be a good balance between Performance and Productivity. That being said, and you said it'd be no surprise to you, I agree that Blaine is the best option. Her scores best fit a balance of the two criteria. Thanks, Cary",NA,NA,"Haley, Based on all of the data available to me regarding the team, I believe the following should be nominated, rationalle included: 1. Sandy Martin - Sandy's scoring for both Customer Service and Teamwork indicate she would serve well in any representative position. She also has all 3 courses completed 2. Quinn Labarre - Quinn also has completed all three courses necessary for a Level 2 job. She has also been receiving mentoring from Jess, a long term representative. 3. Dallas Bobko - Dallas is only short the CS2LSIS class, has excellent scores for Customer Service and Teamwork, and I have, inmy short time, come across an excellent suggestion that should prove beneficial to the team. thanks, Cary",NA,NA,"Taylor, Please discontinue the detective work of searching for the culprit :).

Your answers to these questions will help in the evaluation of your performance by providing a better understanding of your approach and rationale. It is important that you provide complete and thorough answers to the questions below.  For your reference, a list of messages you received today is shown after question 4.  1. Please list the major categories of issues or problems facing Customer Service Team 5 of Soundproof Solutions. Why is each an issue or a problem?  It seems their performance scores are low and I think some favoritism has been played rather than making objective decisions. This has resulted in loss of staffs self worth and they need to be reminded of their importance. There also seems to be some issues with unprofessional, almost childish behavior that needs to be addressed. 2. What were the three most important messages you considered the highest priorities to handle? Why? To me, the highest priorities were any messages related to meetings. They were most important because I needed to havegleened a full understanding of the situation prior to the meeting in order to be effective.  3. List specific examples (if any) of instances where you detected a relationship between two of the messages you received in your inbox. For example, when you decided how respond to one message, did you consider information provided not only in that message, but in other message(s)? It occured to me that there would be several instances of installation scheduling that needed to occur, so I tried to reserve all changes until I could put all of the ""pieces"" together to fit and resolve each situation. 4. Describe what additional information you would have liked to have in order to have a better or clearer understanding of the messages and challenges presented to you today.  I truly believe the all of the information provided me throughout the day and in the pre-work adequately prepared me for my day. I found it most enjoyable and informative. it also offered me an opportunity to do some self evaluation."

I think it's not Larry who's eliminating the errors, but rather it's JJ Paxton, I think we need to have a replacement body or add an additional staff to JJ Paxton team Trim Install to do the installation and leave JJ Paxton on oversseing the entire operation so that errors could be detected by him. As you would see in the chart every time JJ Paxton substitute to one or two of his member, errors go up while if his doing hisjob and somebody else does the subtituting, errors are minimize. Anyway, i'll ask Al if he can ask HR to source additional personnel for JJ's team. thanks , Hi Jenn, I've talked already to the line group leader of line 1, I had asked for her suggestions on how to improve their reults especially the SEQUENCE process, I think you also need to talk to Jamie regarding the SEQUENCE process, I think she can contribute to the improvement. As for the trim Install repairs, I've asked Al if he can provide additional personnel for trim install group of line 1 under JJ Paxton. I think this will solve the issue on further warranty claims. Errors goes up because JJ when substituting for a memeber caould not perform his oversseing functions.",NA,"JJ Thanks for the commitment, I'll talk to Al first okay.

Describe why each entry in Question 2 is an issue or problem. turn table proposal- my approcah was to have the design introduce to the process since the design originated from our own and involves increasing efficiency, however, I need to verify first if we have the buget for it though my predecessor has already it cover but not refeflcted on any offical docs, secondly to have the supplier of the design audited by our quality, if it will pass our standards. and last to see if we can built the design in house. I opted to have the both guys involve get the price since both of them passed the exam with an above average rating, anyway performance is not only measured in paper but rather in daily routine. I would like to talk to them first to get the root cause of the problem, to properly address it. In regards to the absenteeism, I need to talk personaly with Debby to know the reason behind her absences. moving personnel around will not help it the root casue of his/her habitual actions are not evaluated properly. the rumors are rumors until they are manifested, I emailed the concerned leader id it were true that transfers willgoing to take place, I'll see to it that I consult with my group leaders on how to handle the situation in the best interest of everybody. Its very clear that the one overseeing the entire process losses his function by doing other jobs that somebody is assigned, the safety net for error will errode. You dont send a flight attendant to do a Pilot's job. since its involves software upgrade, I scheduled it, so that it would be in parallel with the Managers orientation about Sequence to minimize the disruption on production and also synchronize the survey at the same time to take the opprtunity that we ahave all the teams together in one area. that needs clarification from the production personnel, although the sales person might be right in that instance, but then again the side of the involve personnel should be taken into account as well. anyway, if they were found out guilty of violating the company policy, corrective actions could be undertaken/implemented. that is to be expected when introducing new processes, but again introducing newprocesses should be thought of carefully and have deliberations prior to full implementation to avoid uneccesary situations like this. Again audits are not new, however, audits are not the sole responsibilitry of the production personnel but also of the higher management. if your provide the right tools for the job and the right/modest facility you can expect a personnel to be well prepared for the audit, also by encouraging the group leaders and line leaders of a positive result of audit will benefit them also. suggestion box is a good idea to encourage our people to think but ther should be a criteria as well as a reward to further culminate the idea. nothing new every product which is defective and warranty is calimed should be imvestigated and addressed as sson as possible to minimize further warranty claims. I reccomend the rotation to prevent/avoid complacency. needs to be investigated properly, though my assumption was that the datawas used to created the turn table design, but it might turn out that confidential info isd being leaked out to competitors. most important is the email for warranty claim the 3 least important is the university presentation, the negative feed back from from reg.

SwzuQbSKrCp,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"JJ, As Team Lead, part of your responsibility is to fold Debby into the team and improve her work performance if their are problems.If performance does not improve, ,you must present measurable proof that Debby's job performance is lacking. I will not accept emails with this tone... this seems to be personal rather than based on facts. JJ -- I know from earlier that you are in a Statistics class, so you will understand our Group 1 graph from March that I am attaching. If you look closely at the graph, you will see our repair and rework increases when you are substituting for the line workers. Also, you have had just as many Sick absences as Debby in the same time period. The results show your work on the line can be questioned even more extensively for quality than Debby's. As Team Lead though, your judgments regarding her work seem to be based on personal reasons more than quantitative. I expect way more of our Team Leads, so consider that when I look at this graph it would bring me to consider replacing you despite the other aspects that you excel at. jamie ,","JJ, As you demonstrated with an earlier email about Debby, you seem to be making ill informed decisions regarding your team members or potential team members based on prejudice without presenting facts. It is resistance without reason. Our team leaders need to embrace change and not dismiss it. A good team Lead will find out how to integrate theskills of the Kirkland work force into Bridgeport. Embrace and engage the team in Change. You seem to have embraced SEQUENCE in the manufacturing sense of change but you must also apply the fundamental beliefs in people management also. People are our greatest resource and must be developed and cultivated by sound, capable leaders. SEQUENCE will only be successful if it is installed and supported at all levels of leadership, especially your own position. As front line team lead, you have the most contact and involement with the very workers who manufacture our product. Our companys success and future are only as secure as the team members that continue to make our product the best in industry in all measures. Quality, Cost, Design and Function. i want you to sign up for the Leadership Development program offeredby Soundproof Solutions. Should these types of emails continue or if you continue to lead in this manner, I will consider replacing you immediately upon my return. Jamie ,",NA,NA,NA,"Shea, I prefer session1 beforeshift begins. We will pay Ot. It also gives us an opportunity to get feedback form the talk during the work day. We have 31 employees on Group A Line 1 so lets use room BP07. Thanks jamie ,","Jennifer, I met with pat landis today and he will take over as team lead of the SEQUENCE initiative and training on Line 1 electronics. i am removing Emily from that role as I have buy-in and assurance from pat that he will support and bring the electronics team on board. thanks, Jamie ,",NA,"JJ, I would like to gather some more information on the project before we proceed with ordering and directing the build of the turntable. It sounds like this turntable idea is a great option for saving time, but I would like to run this by Engineering and Safety before proceeding with the order. I will make some time upon my return to hear and make a decision on proceeding. As for now, do not place the order. Thanks, Jamie , Karen, Here is the email from JJ that seems to detail and admit that he did take data from the facility premises. It also details his intentions for the data. Please use this email as evidence in determining if there is any discipline for JJ Paxton and to what extent. Jamie Pace","Isaac, Great to hear that we will be using new programmins software. the team members will be excited about the ability to maks some adjustments themselves rather than going through IT department. I do have a couple of concerns about the timeline. April 13 & 14th -- We need to do a some bit of training with the Line members on the new software and the goals of the trial period. They need to know to observe the performance of the software and accurately report any defiencies for repair or requests for improvements. We can not run the line with the new software without some bit of training. the install of the new software will remove the old one... So we have no fall back and the line will already be down for 1 day for the install. So training before as requested on those dates is a must and withouttraining, we will not proceed with the new software. April 15th -- Install the softwareonly after training is done. the rest of the timeline is fine with me withthe exception that we perform training on the updates and improvements to the software before implementation on May 2nd. So May 2nd -3rd could be finished software training, and May 5th and 6th as implementation. Regards, jamie pace ubject : Upgrades to Robot Software Hi Jamie,  I look forward to meeting you in person. I will be your contact in the Information Technology department. Anything to do with the programming of production machinery is handled exclusively by my team. Please let me know of any programming needs you have and I will do my best to satisfy them.  I have been talking with Al Howard about our new robot programming software. It should help make adjusting the robots and switching between programs much faster than before. Further, your team members will be able to make some adjustments to the robots directly, without involving Engineering or Maintenance. This will save both time and money, and has been approved by both Engineering and Maintenance. It is definitely very different from the current software in place. Al agreed that your group will be the test site for the entire company as we try to get the software finalized.  Here is the rollout plan I propose. Please note these dates.  Friday April 15: Install the software. We will need a full day to install and configure the software. The installation is automated, and will be done over the networkno one will need to go to your plant. However, we will need to take the current system down while we do this. We will remove your existing software at this time as well, since we are replacing it.  April 18-22: Your staff will use the software and report any issues to you. You will send the reports to me and I will act on them.  April 25-29: We will make changes to the software to correct problems found by your team.  May 2: We will officially roll out the new software for your team to use.  Week of May 2-6: We will train your team on using the software now that it is complete.  I talked this over with your team leaders and they had no concerns, but they asked that I take it up with you to confirm that we may go forward with this plan. Note that we are very flexible, so please get back to me by the end of the day with any changes you propose to make to this plan or schedule. However, Al wants to get moving within a week.   Isaac Isaac Tecniov Manager, Information Technology, Team - this is to inform you that IT will be replacing the software on the Final inspection line on April 15 th pending training. this will require downtime of the line on April 15th while the software is installed. Once the new software is installed, the current version will be removed so there is not an option to go back at that point unless we undo everything. So we are committed to move forward and make this work. After the install, I need all departments to be diligent of the quality of the noise breaker models coming from these lines with the new software. So inform your employees that all issues should be reported to their Team Leads. All Team Leads will compile a list of issues ranging from deficiencies that need repair to suggestions for improvement to Emily Carson, who I am assigning as point person. Emily will compile the report and deliver to Isaac so his team can begin implementing the repairs and suggestions. the success of the new software is a team effort so your participation is appreciated. Thanks jamie",NA,"Cory, Attached are the results of the performance survey between Pat landis and JJ paxton that Paul initiated before he left for overseas. As I will be on vacation, the lunch is scheduled April 7 at 12pm - 1pm. i need you to fulfill Paul's desire for this Victory lunch as he indicated that this meant a great deal to both Pat and JJ. Please advise that you can complete this Victory lunch in my absence April 7. If not I will reschdule the lunch following my return from vacation. thanks, Jamie ,",NA,"Vic, I encourage you to call me immediately so that we can discuss the situation involving JJ and the computer disk. I believe JJ is working on a Smart Change proposal and may have simply made an error in judgment regarding removing confidential information from the company property. I am having a F2F with JJ and will get further information from him about what information he left the facility with and see if he will turn over the disk. Thanks for divulging that the information was confidential company information. I will share this information with HR and they can make a formal determination of the course of action involving JJ. As for your involvement, I commend you for looking out for our company and its best interests. However, I think digging and examing contents from JJ's knapsack without his presence and consent is very concerning. i am also advising that Iwill involve HR on this so we can make surethis is not a violation of our security procedures. As of this message, You will not escort JJ Paxton from the company property unlessHR department deemsJJ to be terminated. Regards, Jamie Pace ,","1. No i did not handle each challenge in the order i received them. the meetings broke up the day and I tried to priortize what I thought to be more pressing issues. The safety suggestion box and shift rotation, while I note they are important i felt they could be moved down the calendar some if i didn't have time to complete the exercise. 2. The implementation of a major management system change in SEQUENCE. They need to perform better training of SEQUENCE with the team leads and get buy in from that level to insure its success. They also may need to consider replacing some team leads should they continue to resist. 3. A major operating philosphy or management system change is a huge undertaking. if it is not done with significant care and thought, breakdowns and problems in the beginning can damage employee morale in the system and that will cause it to fail. Front line leaders need to be trained properly on the management system and in leadership techniques since they interact most with the employees and can have the biggest impact on SEQUENCE's success.Original Message----- From: Assessment Administrator Sent: 4/5/2016 1:20 PM To: Pace, Jamie Cc: Subject : About your day (1 of 2)  This e-mail and the one that follows contain some final questions for you.

Please list the major categories of issues or problems facing Final Assembly in the Bridgeport facility of Soundproof Solutions.   3. Describe why each entry in Question 2 is an issue or problem.   3 most important i felt were: Warranty claim because of its effect on our reputation and potential to hurt business. Also sharing that with the team to heighten awareness that quality issues can effect our job and performance. Upgrades to Robot Software because of potential disruption and new operating software that could impact the lines for a long period. Also emloyee training seemed to be an afterthought and that needs correction. Corporate theft -- I had to handle immediately. I thought the accusation and suggestion that Security would escort and terminate the employee after knowing about it for a week was an overreaction. Also, i had more information into what security may have found. I believe all situations about employee misconduct should be run through HR for legal and profeessional guidance. 3 least important were: safety suggestions -- while important that can be pushed back to another day when there is more time for thought and implementaton of an effective, lasting system. job rotation -- just not enough time to put that system in place. Once again, something that needs more thought and planning and can happen at a later day without negative impact to current operations. Rotation changes also needs lots of planning and not knee jerk implementation Corporate audit -- although this is important to let the team members know its coming, if our culture is in place and functioning properly, then we don't have to worry about auditors watching us. We can just do what we do because it is in the culture. 3. Yes there were situations and emails that tied in more info to others. The theft of company info accusation email reminded me of the tidbit of info in JJ's email about the turntable. Also, there were several emails revealing JJ's character that instead of dealing with separately, I could have had a F2F and dealt with a pattern of disturbing emails and possibly considered making a change when the sum of all parts is considered.Original Message----- From: Assessment Administrator Sent: 4/5/2016 1:21 PM To: Pace, Jamie Cc: Subject : About your day (2 of 2)  Following are some of the e-mails that you received today, along with some questions about how you approached them.

I will schedule a meeting with Debby to discuss the situation and review her performance. Before that time I will need to meet with you to get more information to ensure that my assesment of her performance is accurate. We can discuss this at the same meeting as your Turntable idea and I will schedule Debby's performance review immediately after that. Jamie","JJ, I understand your concerns, but you are missing out on a key issue. All of those people who have been with the company from the beginning will be able to provide new ideas and teach us a lot from things they have learned in the past. They may not be the most technical people, but being able to combine thierexperience into our current methodology will improve the teams results. I am not sure how if we are getting and Kirkland people and if we are I do not know how they will be selected. However it is done, I will work to ensure that we get quality people that will benefit the team. Jamie",NA,"Please review the email below. Please sit down with your teams andenforce that the behavior below will not be tolerated. Also, I have seen several emails this morning about the team not buying into the SEQUENCE program. Is this a problem you have noticed as well? Are all of you bought in? We need to work together to ensure that we are providing a unified front to all of the team members. They need to know that SEQUENCE is important and that we allagree with that.We also need to act professionally and not tolerate when others are not acting in an appropriate manner. Jaime",NA,"Shea, Please book room BP07 for the talk. This will provide plenty of room and access to whatever equipment we may need.

Jaime","Jennifer, I looked over the information you provided and came to a different conclusion. It appears that every day that JJ filled in for an absent employee, repairs were very high. However, when JJ was absent and was not backfilled, repairs were on target. It appears that there may be an issue with JJ being on the line. I will discuss this with himto help improve April's numbers. Jaime",NA,"J.J., Thanks for taking the initiative to improve the efficiency of the process. Did you work this out with Paul before he left? Will the new equipment risk speed up installation at the risk of producing a quality product?

I would appreciate it if we could delay the implementation by one week. This will allow me to be around to coordinate the trial with you. Also i noticed that you do not plan on giving my team any training until after the software is optimized. I see this causing some problems because it will be difficult for my team to properly test the new software if they do not know how it works. I propose providing my team training on from 4/18-4/21 and a shorter training session on any changes to the software based on their feedback. This will ensure my team will still be able to operate efficiently and it will give you the feedback you need on what changes need to be made. Let me know if this change creates any problems for you Jaime",NA,"Cory, Per Paul's email below i have reviewed the performance ratings of each individual in the cross training. Paul's method of using the average does not work because there are a few questions where the number is supposed to be low rather than high. I do not really see a clear winner. Each of the leaders has several positive areas and several concerning areas. Because of that here is what I propose. I think we should buy them both lunch and thank them for participating in the experiment. I am concerned that rewarding based on who is ""best"" will cause more harm than good. It will also turn the cross training initiative into a popularity contest instead of a developmental exercise. Once the lunch is over, lets meet with Pat and JJ individually and discuss the results from the survey. As I said i saw several good qualities that were identified but also some bad ones. Jaime",NA,"Vic, JJ was working on a project outside of work to improve the process. He was analyzing data to develop a turntable system that will reduce trim installation time. Do not escort him out or terminate him. However, it does sound like JJ did not follow protocol on taking company information. I will have a discussion with him to ensure it does not happen again. Jaime","1. I handled them pretty much as they came in.I had several emails in my inbox when i started so i started from the bottom up. In the end i noticed that some of the emails were linked to each other and it would have been beneifical to have them all before writing the first reply. Unfortunately I am under a time constraint and didnt know which other emails would be popping up. 2. Some of the major problems are poor communication, lack of diversity and acceptance, and morale. Communication was evident from the phone conversations and some of the emails which made it sound like Paul made a lot of decisions on an island and didnt share with his employees. That led to confusions and poor performance. The diversity problem may just be JJ but if someone is different they are seen as an outcast. JJ also like to push the blame on someone else rather than accept responsibility for issues in his group. Morale was bad because communication was bad and the employees did not feel like they were involved enough in all of the happenings at the company. 3. I explained most of it above. If communication was better, i think a lot of the problems would go away.Original Message----- From: Assessment Administrator Sent: 4/5/2016 1:20 PM To: Pace, Jamie Cc: Subject : About your day (1 of 2)  This e-mail and the one that follows contain some final questions for you.

We will certainly have to put in some time training any new team members on the SEQUENCE initiative and our other processes, but I'm sure any new team members we absorb from Kirkland will be receptive to the training.

I agree that we have some focus issues and I'll be working with the team to try to improve them.

We need to gather data so that we can prove the effectiveness of this change once it's implemented. If it works out, it can be rolled out to the other two lines. One more thing: I certainly appreciate you taking the initiative to look over the statistical analysis outside of work hours, but we do need to be aware of IP protection when sharing information outside the company. Perhaps in the future Emily can help you with statistical analysis for such changes. Let's meet on the 27th afterI returnto go over this project. thanks, Jamie , Hi J.J., As I mentioned in my previous email, we may run into IP issues when sharing data outside of the company. It turns out that the seriousness of the situation was greater than I thought. We need to review the company's policies to make sure that this doesn't happen again. Could you please send me details of what information was shared with your classmates, if it was shared with anyone else, and if there are any copies still out there. I hope you understand why this is an issue and can commit to making sure it doesn't happen again. I am asking Vic Daisha to meet with you to go over our intellectual property policies. Let me know if you have any questions thanks, Jamie","Hi Isaac, We're very excited about this software improvement. Before I can approve the schedule, could you please give me more details on which machines will need to be shut down on Friday the 15th?

Will it be possible to keep some processes running while others are paused for the upgrade? thanks, Jamie ,",NA,"Hi Paul, Thanks for passing along this information. This seems like a good step forward in training our employees on a wider range of skills. If you and Cory feel you need to stick to the original agreement with Pat and J.J., please do so, but I have a suggestion that might get us a better result: While competition is certainly an effective motivational tactic, I think in this situation declaring a winner might have a negative effect on the morale of the losing party and perhaps the whole team. We wouldn't want them to feel that they are being pitted against each other. Since these scores are both so good, I suggest that we declare the competition a tie and congratulate both Pat and J.J. for performing so well, and Cory could buy lunch for both of them. Later, I'll schedule individual meetings with Pat and J.J. to go over their results so that they can use them as a means to further improve. What do you think of this plan? thanks, Jamie ,",NA,"Hi Vic, I understand the gravity of this situation, but I think we would be acting too brashly to terminate J.J.. He had previously explained to me what he was doing with the operations data--he was using it to perform statistical analysis in his personal time. I do not believe he was acting with malicious intent. That said, I understand that removing this data from the building was a violation of our policies, and we need to deal with the issue to make sure it never happens again. I will work directly with J.J. to explain why this is a problem, and to find outhow much was shared outside thecompany.I think it would be helpful if you could meet with him to go over our policies as they regard to information security. J.J. is a valuable team member and I think in this situation he made an honest mistake. I implore you to reconsider his termination and I hope we can work together to recifty this situation in a more constructive way. thanks, Jamie ,","I did not handle the challenges in the order received. Some issues were much higher importance than others, and I handled them as soon as I felt able. Others required more thought, coordination, or information to solve so I waited until later in the assessment. Employee absenteeism--this is an issue because of the poor performance of substitutes at different stations. with proper cross training it could be alleviated. Resistance to SEQUENCE--this is an issue because some employees will resist enough to limit progress and may even sabotage the effort, leading to reductions in performance. Team Morale--many employees are showing poor attitudes and they are beginning to cause problems Lack of Communication -- this is both within the team and across factory units.

Thank you, Jamie nal Message----- From: Paxton, J.J. Sent: 4/5/2016 9:25 AM To: Pace, Jamie Cc: Subject : Debby Britzki Hi Jamie,  Can you please move Debby Britzki to another team? We had our share of time with her, just like the other teams. We heard about all her personal problems, dealt with her not showing up on timeor at all. Shes nice enough, but our rework rates jump when shes having a bad dayand she has way too many of them. Her absenteeism really throws us off, and its time for some other team to put up with her, just like we did when Repair got sick of her.  J.J. J.J. Paxton Lead, Trim Install  , Karen, Here is another possible employee realted issue. I am going to call J.J. to get the specifics on the discussions occurring with Debby Britzki. Do you know of recent attendance issues? How much work has she missed over the past year? Has she taken many personal days or arrived to work late? I wanted to get the facts straight since I am new and just learning about my team. Thanks for your help and insight. Feel free to call meif you get a chanceso we can talk about this situation. I want to keep the harmony in the Trim Install Department so I need to address the issue as soon as possible. Thank you. Jamie","J.J. If we absorb workers from Kirkland, we will give everybody the same opportunity to learn about SEQUENCE, including the technology. We will need a diverse prospective from each of the workers and I am sure everyone will have something unique to contribute. With that said, I do not want to make any assumptions on people transferring over. Please wait until an official announcement is made. Continue to work with your team and focus on day to day operations so you do not get side-tracked with rumors. Kevin ,",NA,"Karen, I might need a little direction here. I wanted to pass this note along to you from Alex. Looks like we could have two seperate issues. This occurred during a recent sales tour. Velma Miller had several reports of inappropriateconduct that islisted below. I am not sure if there is anything that can be done at this point since she wasn't exactly sure who said what.

Jamie ,","Shea, Please update the Group A calendar with the dates listed below. We can accomodate Isaac with the reboot. Send out an email to the group to communicate the project. Let me know if you have any quesitons. Hi Jamie,  I look forward to meeting you in person. I will be your contact in the Information Technology department. Anything to do with the programming of production machinery is handled exclusively by my team. Please let me know of any programming needs you have and I will do my best to satisfy them.  I have been talking with Al Howard about our new robot programming software. It should help make adjusting the robots and switching between programs much faster than before. Further, your team members will be able to make some adjustments to the robots directly, without involving Engineering or Maintenance. This will save both time and money, and has been approved by both Engineering and Maintenance. It is definitely very different from the current software in place. Al agreed that your group will be the test site for the entire company as we try to get the software finalized.  Here is the rollout plan I propose. Please note these dates.  Friday April 15: Install the software. We will need a full day to install and configure the software. The installation is automated, and will be done over the networkno one will need to go to your plant. However, we will need to take the current system down while we do this. We will remove your existing software at this time as well, since we are replacing it.  April 18-22: Your staff will use the software and report any issues to you. You will send the reports to me and I will act on them.  April 25-29: We will make changes to the software to correct problems found by your team.  May 2: We will officially roll out the new software for your team to use.  Week of May 2-6: We will train your team on using the software now that it is complete.  I talked this over with your team leaders and they had no concerns, but they asked that I take it up with you to confirm that we may go forward with this plan. Note that we are very flexible, so please get back to me by the end of the day with any changes you propose to make to this plan or schedule. However, Al wants to get moving within a week.   Isaac Isaac Tecniov Manager, Information Technology,",NA,"Cory, Please review the attachment of survey results when you get the chance. According to Paul, there was some serious competition between Pat and J.J.. As far as I can see, they are rated about equal in the survey. I disagree that one should be placed ahead of the other based on the results. I think both have important characteristics and qualities from a leading perspective. I think if would be great if you and I could get together on the 7th and buy them both lunch! Let me know if you can make it. Thanks, Kevin ,",NA,"Vic, I appreciate the concern for Bridgeport Manufacturing security.

Thanks a million!",NA,NA,NA,"Vic, That is bitter sweet. It is unfortunate that this took place. However, I'm glad to hear that you were able to prevent further damage from taking place potentially. Thanks for the information.","1. I attempted to handle the emails in order of importance and according to their deadlines. I also tried to take into consideration  the amount of work that each situation required. There were a couple of emails that only required a short reply, so I was able to  handle them almost immediately. Others required additional thought and/or research so it took time to draft proper responses. 2. Final Assembly faced a host of issues during this exercise. They are as follows: a.Customer satisfaction b.Product quality c.Employee performance d.Employee moral e.Employee conduct f. Effective leadership  3a.Customer satisfaction - Every organzation has customers of some sort, whether paying or otherwise. The organization's responsibility is to provide its customers with goods and/or services to their satisfaction.If the organization fails to do so, it it willcease to exist.Therefore, lack of customer satisfaction indicates that the organization is not fulfilling its base purpose. Lack of customer satisfaction is the chief of all problems, because all problems either lead toitor  havethe potential to do so.  b. Product quality - In this scenario the lack of product quality had the potential to hinder the acquisition of a new customer by  decreasing the potential customer's confidence in the Soundproof's product during a field trial. Therefore dissuading the  customer from committing to a larger purchase.Accordingly, the effect of poor product quality could result int theloss of  business. c. Employee performance - Employee's are the driving force of an organization. They physically produce the the output of goods/services. Therefore,lackluster employee performance can lead to unsatisfactory products/services, ultimately affecting the success of the business. Take JJ Paxton forinstance. Every time he substituted for one of his line  members, the amount of Trim Line Repairs increased substantially due to his poor performance. In result, this type of activity  slows down the production process andhinders the company's ability to produce on schedule. d. Employee moral - Lowemployee moral can negatively affect the employee's willingness and/or ability to produce quality work.For instance, Debbie Britzki's personal problems led to her chronic absenteeism. This in turncreatedfeelings of  frustration and the teamsinability to perform asexpected. e.Employee conduct - Employee conduct can affect many aspects of an organization. This includesthe work environment,  safety, and the customer. In this case improper employee conduct had a negative impact on the perception of a potential  customer who happened to be visiting the plant. In fact, the customer found it offensive. This could've ledto the lossof  businesson top of legal consequences. f.Effective leadership - Ineffective leadership will almost undoubtedly lead to the misappropriation of resources.This  includes man-hours, tools, and materials.Poor leaders often times have the ability to create the most damage as they tend  tohave access sensitive or valuable property. An example of this was demonstrated in the this case by JJ Paxton attempting  toremove a disk containing intellectual property. The impact of this type activity could be devastating to an organization.Original Message----- From: Assessment Administrator Sent: 4/5/2016 12:31 PM To: Pace, Jamie Cc: Subject : About your day (1 of 2)  This e-mail and the one that follows contain some final questions for you.

Furthermore, the Theft  ofCompany Information changed the way the I viewed the Kirkland Plant, Debby Britzki, and Warranty Claim emails.

Please list the major categories of issues or problems facing Final Assembly in the Bridgeport facility ofSoundproof Solutions. Resistance toSEQUENCE initiative Breach of information QA initiative   3. Describe why each entry in Question 2 is an issue or problem. Resistance to SEQUENCE initiative Many people are resistant to ne processes so its the management's role to ensure that the benefits and purpose are well explained up to the lowest member of the corporate ladder. By keeping every member informed on what's the rationale of each new process they will be motivated to do their partand therefore build ownership to every individual. Also streamlining a process leads to a lower cost/product sold and thus higher profit margin and more competitive in the market. IP is so important that many people take for granted. It leads to the downfall of any company when their confidential information became known to the competitors and the black market. In this scenario, Soundproof is not a diversed company and their core business is limited to noise reduction speakers. Therefore, if their confidential info get's out of the company, the result will be detrimental. QA initiative Quality is of utmost importance since it also translates to cost and at the same time value added to the product and the customers. With Qulaity in mind, employees learn to minimize scrap and time spent on rework.

Paxton is suspected of stealing company-confidential information  1. What were the three most important and the three least important e-mails to handle? The three most important for me are: Theft of company information: J.J. Paxton is suspected of stealing company-confidential information Professional conduct: Salesperson unnerved by team member behavior during customer tour Request for a plan to investigate warranty claims for a customers new units least important : Victory lunch: Al and Paul will buy lunch for the group leader with better performance survey results Kirkland plant: Concern about team members transferring from an older plant Suggestion box: Proposal for an incentive plan to increase team members suggestions 2. Why did you feel that the e-mails you rated as most important were critical? Those thre identified for meare the most critical since they will have a big effecton thecompany as a whole.Confidential information is the main reason why companies have core products/business. Also, Customers should be treated professionally otherwiseany unprofessional doings by any employee will reflect on the company as a whole. Same with investigating warranty claims. In addition to providinggood customer service,the company alsoshould look rightawayon these issues to minimize further damage and additional costs.  3. Why did you feel that the e-mails you rated as least important were low priorities? Victory lunch is part of life andone way to enjoy but does not have abig effect rightaway on the company. Also,in any company, no one is indespensable. Everybody could be replaced.Incentive planswouldincrease the moraleof every individualand will not have a majorand immediate effect on the company.We need to check its effect to sustainability."

I will be your contact in the Information Technology department. Anything to do with the programming of production machinery is handled exclusively by my team. Please let me know of any programming needs you have and I will do my best to satisfy them.  I have been talking with Al Howard about our new robot programming software. It should help make adjusting the robots and switching between programs much faster than before. Further, your team members will be able to make some adjustments to the robots directly, without involving Engineering or Maintenance. This will save both time and money, and has been approved by both Engineering and Maintenance. It is definitely very different from the current software in place. Al agreed that your group will be the test site for the entire company as we try to get the software finalized.  Here is the rollout plan I propose. Please note these dates.  Friday April 15: Install the software. We will need a full day to install and configure the software. The installation is automated, and will be done over the networkno one will need to go to your plant. However, we will need to take the current system down while we do this. We will remove your existing software at this time as well, since we are replacing it.  April 18-22: Your staff will use the software and report any issues to you. You will send the reports to me and I will act on them.  April 25-29: We will make changes to the software to correct problems found by your team.  May 2: We will officially roll out the new software for your team to use.  Week of May 2-6: We will train your team on using the software now that it is complete.  I talked this over with your team leaders and they had no concerns, but they asked that I take it up with you to confirm that we may go forward with this plan. Note that we are very flexible, so please get back to me by the end of the day with any changes you propose to make to this plan or schedule. However, Al wants to get moving within a week.  Isaac Isaac Tecniov Manager, Information Technology, Hi Jaime/Jesse, Please see schedules below for the IT Robot Software Upgrade. Please ensure that your on top of this. Thanks",NA,"Jaimee, Great Job, well its a developmental ""friendly"" competition. Our motive here is to motivate Pat and JJ. Somebody has to win. However we can first discuss the createria's separetely to both of them. Then for the purposes of compettiton we can announce Pat his well deserved achievements. Thats the objective of this effort isn't it? Lunch with the Boss is a very good motivational strategy. It works. You may send Al the results immediatly . Thanks Cory ,",NA,"Hi Vic/Al In connection with the violation of JJ. Paxton, if it violates company policy , then I have no disagreement on the sanction. I believe Security will be working on due-process, if it calls for termination. I fully uinderstand that violation of Information Security and illegal downloading of proprietary information is a grave offense. Vic, please send me a copy of your investigation report. thanks Corry ,","My Answer: 1. I handled each and every email in order of priority. There are challenges that can be decided immediately while others needed to be evaluated to ensure that all aspects of the concern has been evaluated. Of course, I made some prioritization on the emails coming from the Top Management, as it may require my immediate services, opinions and actions. There are challenges that may require escalation on top level, especially on aspects of disciplinary actions, sanctions, transfer that may need the attention, perusal and approval of the upper echelons. 2. Based on my observation as I went thru the process, BridgePort Final Assembly has been is facing the challenge of Communication Gaps- there were new system like the SEQUENCE that maybe a very good solution to increase work efficiency, however its real essense has not been cascaded properly down the line. The values of SEQUENCE and its importance was not realized across the team members. Thereby creating division between those who believes in the new system and those who still embraces the old system. I recommend an Open Line of Communication system. Lack of Team Work- Each and every line seems to compartmentalized their actions in the production, thereby causing operational delays and stumbling blocks. The HR or Developmental Department should introduce a system that will create a mind set of Winning as a Team. HR Functions- Part iof the HR Functrion is to look into development of every employee in the company. Hearing their grievances will imoprove their morale and would be beneficial to the company as a whole. There are lots of potential leaders in Bridegeport that may be useful to the company only when properly unleashed. Ownership- To ensure good quaity of producrs and reduce inventories, Bridgeport should device a way to promote ""OWNERSHIP as part of the values of each and every employee. Competitiveness- More technical trainings should be conducted, so that workers are abreast with new technology. Promote competiveness by showing market share briefings. Over-all BridgePort is still on its way-up, having other competitor as benchmark. Surely, it will be achieved by re-engineering not only technically but also giving preferece to its integral asset which is their workers.Original Message----- From: Assessment Administrator Sent: 4/5/2016 12:15 PM To: Manning, Cory Cc: Subject : About your day (1 of 2) This e-mail and the one that follows contain some final questions for you.

As we both know Larry is a seasoned employee with over 20 years of service, but at times he is hesisitant to change. It was very dishearting to hear the words from Larry towards Emily. He truly is not bought into the SEQUENCE program as of yet. I want you to schedule a meeting with the trim install team and discss our expectations as a company and report back to me. Further more I will be discussing the issue with Emily to see if she wants to make a formal complaint. You will need to follow back up with me on the results from the meeting with the Trim Team. ,",NA,"J.J.. I apprecatie your efforts as time lead.

Larry has had some issues with conduct regarding the SEQUENCE program in the past. We need to set a clear expectation to these two individuals reagarding this.",NA,"The 21st will work fine.

As you will see within the results, Pat scored better than J.J. I know that you offered lunch for the winner, but as you can see both excelled and areas. Both also scored low in some areas. I do beleive that we have a avenue to capture this and use this to our advantage and not just for competition. I believe we should setup a meeting with both J.J. and Pat, buy lunch, discuss the results and offer formal training for those areas identified. Clearly this has identified some areas that we need to address. Even though there are some high scores in some areas there is still an opportunity for improvement. ,",NA,"Vic, I apprecaite you bringing this situation to light. There are some concerns I have with terminating J.J. Your time lapse from which this happened. Today is the 5th and in your notes you said this happened last week.

I will send out a meeting notice within the half hour. ,","I tried to handle each situation as I recevied it. Due to the emailing system, you can not clearly track if you sent out a response or not. So I tried to stay in line. One major issue is the communicatio between the groups. Information was not given if this is a non-union or union facility. At times the situation give a clue that is was, but again at times it was not so clear. Second issue is the training process for the facility for the SEQUENCE. Seems that the training needs to be catered for the workgroup. Some where struggling with the process. clearly this causes some groups to form for the program and not for the program. Third, you have a issue with company integrity. Twice there were instances where employees clearly violated this. One when J.J. copied material to take home and the other when Quinn tried to utilize another companies setting for our work here.

These effect our efficiency and competitiveness. Some of the emails from Paul Bern were helpful. They truly described how out of touch with communciation he was and how his group faired with this. He ran the line like a competion with his group and the entire organization. Attitude reflects leadership and thus was reflected in some of the actions of his former team.

Since I am leaving today, Cory Manning will be your contact person until my return on April 20. I have copied him in this email. He will let you know if the final approved date for the installation. If we do not get approval to push back the installation I will need the following from you: - basic training for my group prior to installation, this is completely new software to them. - a representative on-site April 18 to April 22 to address immediate concerns that may halt production. - leave the existing software in place until the new software has been installed, tested, and repaired. Also, when the system is down during installation, will this completely halt production? If so, I'll need to work with scheduling to make sure we have allotted downtime for this project. If you can't get back with me by the end of today, please contact Cory with that information. Thanks, Jamie Pace , Cory, I've copied you on a couple email concerning this software upgrade. I definately see a couple opportunities with the installation schedule. We can't expect everyone to be able to run the new software with absolutely no training. And if this software is critical to the operation, then we definately need a representative on-site to help us work through the initial troubleshooting phase. I've asked Al to push the installation back one week so I can be available for the start up. This will also give us more time to train our teams on the new software changes. Please let Isaac know if the April 22 installation date was approved by Al. If it is approved, I'll handle the prject when I return. If we have to move forward with the April 15 installation, could you please follow up on the concerns I outlines in my respone to Isaac?

For the most part challenges were handled in the order they were received. I made certain to finish one challenge before moving on to the next. This allowed me to make sure I completely followed up on each task before moving on to the next. I did jump in to address the possible theft issue because it posed an immediate issue.   2. Please list the major categories of issues or problems facing Final Assembly in the Bridgeport facility of Soundproof Solutions. The team has a lack of engagement in the SEQUENCE process. Many individuals are not aligned with the values of the company. They need individual coaching to address behaviors that are detrimental to the company and their coworkers.   3. Describe why each entry in Question 2 is an issue or problem. The lack of engagementwill ultimately lead to the failure ofSEQUENCE and a lack of competitiveness for the company. The lack of alignment is causing hostility among employees and ongoing issues on the production line.

Paxton is suspected of stealing company-confidential information   1. What were the three most important and the three least important e-mails to handle? TheWarranty Claim, Corporate Audit, and Theft were the 3 most important. The job roatation, suggestion box, and Kirkland plant were the least important.  2. Why did you feel that the e-mails you rated as most important were critical? The warranty claim is a potentional huge loss for the company and needs the most attention. The corporate audit represents the facility as a whole and needs everyone's attention. The theft was critical because JJ may be unjustly terminated.   3.Todays assessment provided you with background information about Soundproof Solutions and also presented thechallenging messages listed above. Were there situations where information from one source/challenge helped you to better understand and address anotherchallenge? If so, please list specific examples of theseinstances (Example: Message X related to Message Z, Company Policies related to Message Y, etc.). Information from JJ on the turntable project assisted with the theft of company property issue. The observation of Larry and Emily assisted with the SEQUENCE talk issue."
EkoUilnExen,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"JJ, We will need to pull aside Larry Hodges today and discuss with him the interaction between him and Emily. It is appearent that Larry has some issues with regards to the SEQUENCE program and we need to better understand what those issues are so we can address them with him. He is a valuable member of our team and we need him on-board if we are going to succeed with this. Let me know when the two of you are available today. ,",NA,"I am sorry JJ but I do not think moving Debby to another team is going to help Debby or the company. We need to find ways to help Debby workthrough her issues. Have you mentioned the EAP program to her? Also are you documenting the circumstances involved in her ""bad days"". I will consil her on her attendance issues but you need to focus on holding her accountable for her performance and bring to my attention when she is lacking. Please do not wait until this boils over before getting me involved. Thanks Jamie ,","JJ, I do not think it is appropriate to classify the personnel at Kirkland in such a manner. We need the help and these are experience associates that should only take a minimum amount of training to get up to speed. I have full confidence in your ability to provide the proper training needed to successfully integrate these new associate and to do so in a possitive manner. ,",NA,"Alex: Please extend my appoligies to Velma with regards to the behavior she was exposed to by my trim team. I appears I have some work to do with them. I will certainly mention this to JJ Paxton, my team leader in Trim Install, and will be focusing on getting the trim team on-board with the SEQUENCE program. I am sencing some resentment with a few of the team members for SEQUENCE and need to address the concerns they have with it. I will also have JJ be more focused on keeping the work areas more organised and neat. If there is anything else you need from me please let me know. Thanks Jamie ,",NA,"Shea, We have 29 associates working in group A line 1 so I would think room BP07 would be the most appropiate. Also I think the most appropiate time to have this talk is 1st thing in the morning while the team is wide awake. Maybe Al can provide breakfast style food for the group. It will also give the team the entire day to talk amongst themselves about SEQUENCE and hopefully come across with some possitive feedback from this. If you need anything else from me just let me know. Thanks Jamie ,","Jennifer, Thanks for the heads up. Certainly Larry is an important member of the trim team but what is becoming clear to me is that we need to focus on crosstraining all members of the trim team so that when someone, even Larry, is off I do not have to use JJ to fill in. His leadership is needed on the floor so I plan on putting together a crosstraining plan when I get back to address this issue. Thanks again. Jamie ,",NA,NA,"Isaac, I will be on vacation starting tomorrow and will be out until 4/22. I would prefer that we start the roll out after my return but if we need to start this sooner than that please make sure that my team leaders are involved and informed as to what is needed from their end so that they can support this and prevent any unnessesary intruptions to production. Thanks Jamie ,",NA,"Thanks Paul. I will pass the results onto Paul and JJ and congratulate both. Jamie , Cory, I recieved this from Paul. I was not aware of this contest but it is clear Paul won so I guess you owe him lunch. More importantly I would like to focus on the areas both did not fare well in and see if we can provide some further training or educational opportunity for them in those areas to help further thier development. Your thoughts? Jamie",NA,"Vic, I think you are over reacting here. We need to do a thorough investigation regarding this and determine what exactly happened here. JJ is a team leader and does some research work for us so this may be legit. I think we should suspend JJ pending an investigation and if it is found to be theft then we should terminate JJ. But if it found to be legit then we should pay JJ for the time off. Cory, I think you need to get involved with this. ,","Original Message----- From: Assessment Administrator Sent: 4/5/2016 11:31 AM To: Pace, Jamie Cc: Subject : About your day (1 of 2)  This e-mail and the one that follows contain some final questions for you.

Please list the major categories of issues or problems facing Final Assembly in the Bridgeport facility of Soundproof Solutions. 1) Associates are resistant to SEQUENCE due to mis trust 2) Team leaders are not fully trained on proper leadership technics 3)Morale seems to be low.   3. Describe why each entry in Question 2 is an issue or problem. 1) It seems that they have a more senior work force that are resistant to change 2) Team leaders would rather pass off their problems than deal with them. That is a sign of a lack of training and skill development 3) A lot of complaining by associates and performance issues would suggest there are morale issues here.

The major issues were the Warranty Claim, the upcoming audit, implementing Sequence and implementing job rotation. 3. The warranty claim was a major issue because it affected future business for the company. The audit was an issue because the team members and work areas need to be in compliance with the set standards. Implenting Sequence is an issue because it will impact the cost and efficiency of the plant. Finally implenting the job rotation is an issue because of teh team members and their concerns.Original Message----- From: Assessment Administrator Sent: 4/5/2016 12:31 PM To: Pace, Jamie Cc: Subject : About your day (1 of 2)  This e-mail and the one that follows contain some final questions for you.

Im OK with having him as your replacement during your leave.It will help himto be more hands on & get the feel of things and at the same time working on his gaps. We will see his progress from there on. Thanks! Cary","Hi Alex, Thanks for the escalation. I apologise for my team's behaviour. I will ensure that this issue is being addressed with the team. Thanks!","Hi Haley, Thats great! From the performance data below, I must agree that these are very good workers indeed. With that being said,although it was quite tough for me to choose, I think I would promote Blaine Lerner. As you mentioned in your email, hehas a very strong performance index score and I think that is importantinSoundproof Solutions as we take Customer Service very seriously. I had the chance tohave a little chat with each of them to get to know them better, hence helping me make my decision for this promotion. I know that Eden Webb's productivity score is higher, however,I found that Blaine took just awhilelongerto serve each customer because he is very pleasant to talk to and takes the effort to build relationships with customers, assuring that any inquiries, issues or complaints are being attended immediately. I think these qualities are very important in building customer'strust, respect and mutual understanding. Further more, his productivity scorestill exceeds the corporate standards. So he has a good balance ofboth. Would you agree? Cary",NA,NA,"Hi Haley, Below are the 3 selected candidates & the rationale. Name: Jamie Dubrovich Training needed: CS2LSIS Rationale: -have gone thru 2 out ou 3 trainings -scored A (superior) in Customer Service Ratings -scored B (Above Average) in Teamwork ratings Name: Quinn Labarre Training needed: None Rationale: -have gone thru all 3 trainings -scored B+ (Above average) in Customer Service Ratings -scoredA (Superior) in Teamwork ratings Name: Dallas Bobko Training needed: CS2LSIS Rationale: -have gone thru 2 out ou 3 trainings -scored B (Above Average) in Customer Service Ratings -scoredA (superior) in Teamwork ratings Thanks! Cary",NA,NA,"Hi Taylor, I understand your concern and I agree, we need to do something about this. However, what do you suggest we do after we have caught the person who wrote the message? I'm not sure it would give a good impression on other workers if we penalise or punish the person and it would just end up embarassing Eluto & the writer. I'm afraid of what environment that will be created in the future after such incident. Hence, rather than catching the culprite behind the message, I suggest we come up with a staff engagement activity together with HR.This will helpthem to get to know each other better and bond with each otherto avoid these kinds ofenvironment. We could include activities that involves team work as well as development. I think it will really help in creating a deeper more healthierrelationships amongst staffsand at the same time create a better work environment moving forward.We can have it done quarterly, at different places doing different fun games & activities. What say you? Cary",NA,"Hi Taylor, Thanks for the information below. No doubt, Mr Weedler's complaints does soundvery questionable. I think we can't do much about the previous orders as we have no proof (or do we?). However,I think we can do somethingabout it from now on. Since it has been more than one time, it is our policy to getMr Weedler toreturn the defective product to us within 15 days. With this, he wont be able to use both products for two different jobs. One other way is to get ourproduct & sales team to verify the quality of the product and getMr Weedler'ssignature on the document saying he agrees that the level of quality meets his expectations at the point of delivery the first time around. With this, no replacement can be made. We can try the first solution first, andsee where it goes. Thanks! Cary","Thanks for the heads up Liang. I am aware of this as Tracy have informed me that he has been going to a statistics class after work and needed real life data to be analysed. He has actually shared with me the results of his findings that will also help the company moving forward. However, i agree with you that such data should not have been retrieved and used as such without any authorisation. I will sit down with Tracy later today and explain to him of his actions and get him to remove any data he has stored in his disk immediately. We'll justgive him a warning this time around. I'm sure he will be more careful in the future. We'll have a memo sent to everyone reminding them of such actions and consequences. Thanks again for informing me. You've done a good job in assuring the company's security. Keep it up! Cary",NA
IEDHXaRLvgD,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Dear Tracy, Thank you for sharing with me your work. It is indeed interesting statistic you have there in your report and I am pleased to hear that you are using some real world data for your Statistic class. I have looked at the graph and please find my thoughts onyour analysis: 1. It is interesting to note from your graph that when call time is lower, the customer satisfaction is rated to be higher. I believe a larger sampling size (around 50-100 calls) would be able togive you strongerjustification on this. 2. You might also want to consider additional parameters that correlate to customer satisfaction. For example, type of calls (e.g enquiries, installation schedulling or customer complaints).It would be interesting to find out the customer satisfaction level vs the type of calls we received. I hopemy abovethoughts have provided you some extra insights to probe on. I like your idea on sharing the information with Haley in the next staff meeting. We can even have this on-going as a permanent project to get customer analytics. What I would like to suggest before your meeting with her, is to add additional sample size and correlated parameters in your statistic. I would be happy to review this again with youprior to your presentaion. What do you think?  I will be going for a 2 weeks vacation starting from tomorrow, but I can do over a con-call with you anytime in this weekend. Let me know. Also, I would like to let you know that I spoke to HRand there are somenon -disclosuredocuments that you need to adhere to while completing this project.Iwantto highlight to you that customer's name and address are notto be revealed in anycase. I willgive you a call to explain this further. Do keep up the good work. Regards, Cary",NA,NA,"Dear Taylor, This is indeed good news. I am a strong believer in mentoring and I am happy that you have taken proactive steps to coach Jerry. Thank you for also sharing the coordinator survey response with me. I enhoed with you that Jerry's performance is indeedgood.  I also agree with you that the average score gives good indication onJerry'soverall performance. What I would like to add is that, there are 3 parameters that I am a bit concern about. The questions oni) effective communication, ii) treats everyone fairly and iii) inspires everyone to do thier best, Jerry seems to fair not as well in this areas. I believe that this will come with experience and I suggest that you highlight thesedevelopment areas toJerry during your coaching. On your note to have Jerry as your replacement for Thursday and Friday, I totally agree to this suggestion. I think is good forJerry's exposure and also a chance for him to take on more responsibility. Please go ahead to schedule this. Regards, Cary","Dear Alex, Thank you for highlighting this to me. I take ethics in work very seriously andwould put immediate attention to thesituation youjust raised. Allow me some time to address this. I will find out more details from my team and follow through a call with you later. Regards, Cary","Dear Haley, Thank you so much for the good news! Indeed, my team Taylor has also expressed that many of our TPTs are interested to take on a more permanent position. I went through Barney's personal notes and also the 1st quarter results for the i)Teamwork Rating and ii) Customer Service Ratings. This has given me some insights on the rep's performancefor the past yearand I would like to sharesome of my thoughts with you. 1. Blaine has indeed score consistently for both thePerformance &Productivity index. Thishas also echoed with Barney's remark saying that he worksbest under supervision.Myconcern is that from the customer service & team work point of view,both of his marks were hitting only at C+. 2. Eden whom you rightly pointed, have scored the highest in the Productivity Index. However, similar findings with Blaine, he did not do as well in the customer service & team work rating where he scored C and D+ respectively. 3. I have not spoken to Kim yet to get her thoughts and feedback, however, Corey and Dallas Bobko stand out to me. Both of them did above average in the customer service index. They also excel in the teamwork index. At the moment, I don't think I have sufficient justification to select the person to be promoted. I would like to suggest we have a face to face short interview with all 4 of them in the coming week. If it is okay with you, I would also like to have Kim to be the interviewer panel. She has the most interaction with them and I believe we can get some of her thoughts. Let me know your thoughtsand I can find time with Cheryl to arrangefor the said interview. Thank you. Regards Cary",NA,NA,"Dear Haley, Thank you for your e-mail and please find my nomination below: 1. From Permanent Staff - I would like to nominate Jamie and Quinn. Both have scored well in the customer service and teamwork index.Jamie will have to be enrolled in CS2LSIS course 2. From the TPT Staff - I would like to nominate Dallas. His score in the Performance and Productivity index is not as high as others, but I believe he has shown very good teamwork (A in the quater 1 result). He has also given me very good suggestion on the project database issue that we faced with Cyd. Infact, he will be taking lead to revamp the said CRM. Similar to Jamie, he will require to take the CS2LSIS course. Thank you. Let me know if you have any other thoughts on the nomination.

Jamie","I started out answering emails as I received them. Then, I answered some when i read them, others I came back to. Some of the issues needed immediate response and others I could come back to. Seems like to most problems we face are absentees and employees working well with each other. All companys are usually starting a new project, that is how we grow. We just need to make sure training, and all information is accessable to each person involved. Answering all these questions and problems is quite hard because i don't really know anyone. Being all ficticous makes it hard. Leaders need to get to know their people, and their problems. If anyone has problems, not work related, but they bring to work, as in one email, that person really need professional help. Being bounced around from dept to dept only makes the problem worse. I know we can't fix everything, but just showing the person we care goesa long way. Being a lead person carries a big load. I depend on co-workers and management to help me in my process. Along with being, hopefully, a good person.Original Message----- From: Assessment Administrator Sent: 4/5/2016 12:31 PM To: Pace, Jamie Cc: Subject : About your day (1 of 2)  This e-mail and the one that follows contain some final questions for you.

If she really is causing delay to your team, it's not advisable to just transfer her to another team. It will probably make the other teams inefficient.

Resistance of team workers/leaders to adapt to the SEQUENCE Program Low Morale workers & Absenteeism Inter-team communication Model 1 Problem  3. Describe why each entry in Question 2 is an issue or problem. Resistance - Most of the problems encountered were due to resistance to adapt to SEQUENCE. It's either resistance to complete the training or when doing problem solving, they still use the old and basic method. Most of the characters does not really want to come out of their box and just want to continue work as is. Low Morale & Absenteeism - this contributes a lot to the slowing of production and increasing rework thus increasing production cost. Inter-team communication - Most of the problems they encountered are due to miscommunication and false assumption. Problems with implementing the SEQUENCE, problems with the amplifier assembly which the electronics shop experimented without informing the the install team. False assumption of Mel going to Emby Flint and to JJ stealing company imformation. Model 1 Problem - It is a major issue since the root cause is unidentified.

I will address this my team and make sure that we will not have such issues by the next customer tour Thanks, Boris",NA,"Shea, It would be great if we can do it as the companyorganizedlunchat 12:00pm on April 21st.BP07 will work the bestso we can sit everyone and it has projector as well. Thanks, Boris",NA,NA,"J.J., Thanks for updating me on this. It sounds like an interesting idea which we might need to implement. However I must put it on hold for now. SmartChanges process requires that we review a proposal with a key stakeholders and I don't see on your list neither Engineering nor Maintenance. Before we proceed with placing the order I want you to review it with Carson and Harley. We should discuss it again when you get their feedback. Thanks, Jamie","Isaac, This is sound like a great improvement. However I have a few issuses that I would like to clarify with you. IS it possible to perform the upgrade on Saturday to avoid stopping of the line? If not we need to evaluate the impact on revenue vs possible benefits and make sure that everyone including Al is on board with it. Next, you mention team training on a new software on May 2-6 after the rollout. Is not it too late for the training? Should not we do it before the rollout? What about limiting rollout of the software update to only portion of the line, say Electronics install and see if there are any issues with workers interacting with the new software? I will be back on April 20, so we can meet then and go over this in person. I would prefer not to do the update before April 20. Thanks, Boris",NA,"Cory, Just a reminder that we have Victory lunch coming with Pat on April 7th. Unfortunately I will be away to take part in this, so can you congratulate Pat on Thursday? I don't want to break this news to him and J.J. before that so J.J. don't feel so bad about losing. Thanks, Jamie",NA,"Vic, I jsut left you a voicemail. I think there is a grave misunderstanding. J.J. was working on assembly imrpovement and he analyzed the data athome tomake sure thatthe process is optimized. While I agree that it is a grave security breach and J.J. should not do that, I don't think there was any malicious intent and no harm was done yet. I don't think J.J. really understand wht he has done and what consequences will be. J.J. is a goodemploee and he did what he thought the best for the company. We need people like him working hard and pushing innovations for the company. Weshould not let him go over this without investigation on what exactly has happened and if any harm was done.Please, do not proceed with termination paperwork without consulting me and/or Cory first. I propose that we setup a meeting today to resolve this issue with you, myself, Cory and however else you think is appropriate. Thanks, Jamie","1. I did not open them in the order I received them. I tried to guess based on the sender and subject which email appears to be more important and respond to it first. 2. a) People are not on board with change coming in a way of SEQUENCE process. b) Low morale due to some of the team leads not leading the team and low quality due to some of the team leads not being good workers in the first place. c) Confrotations between groups instead of collaboration. 3. a) The company is lagging behind competitors in cost per product and in innovations. If things are not turned around the company will lose sales and market share. Things can not go the way they were before. b) Bad morale discourage improvement, productivity and change. Three things that compny needs most. c) Confronation between amplifier assembly and electronics installation lead to line stop , i.e. producivity drop. The changes implemented by amp. group where not checked by assembly group because they don't see eachother as partners.

While I'd plan to have a talk with Larry and engage him in an assignment related to SEQUENCE , it is important that we send out communication to all our employees about the importance of SEQUENCE , support required from each of the employee ETC .

I will have to find a replacement quickly since he was the lead man in Trim Install. Jamie","1. I handled the emails in the way they were delivered into my inbox. 2. Some major problems with Bridgeport assembly were the install panels for the speakers being defective. Weather is was material replated or employee assembly related. Better cross-training is needed for jobs in each group and in different groups, so employees can rotate around to different jobs easier. Professional work conduct is also another issue at Bridgeport. 3. Defective install panels for the speakers is a problem because we want repeat business from costumers. I think for that to happen then a quality product has to be producted 100% of the time, so there is no inconsistencies between products that constumers are gettting. Every costumer should get the excellent quality 100% of the time. Finding the root of the problem and ways to correct said problem should be implemented. Cross-training of team members in the same group and for different groups would be beneficial because if all team members know how to assemble a noisebreaker in its entirety then we can keep a constant job rotation, so it keeps everything fresh and team members don't get complacent in their job. Professional conduct is also important because it keeps order in a work enviroment. The more order and structure there is in a work enviroment the safer it is for employees and everyone around.Original Message----- From: Assessment Administrator Sent: 4/5/2016 12:31 PM To: Pace, Jamie Cc: Subject : About your day (1 of 2)  This e-mail and the one that follows contain some final questions for you.

Did you handle each challenge in the order you received it, or did you handle them another way? Please describe your approach.   2. Please list the major categories of issues or problems facing Final Assembly in the Bridgeport facility of Soundproof Solutions.   3. Describe why each entry in Question 2 is an issue or problem.   1 Most important: . Warrantly Claim, Professional conduct, job rotation. Least important: victory lunch, suggestion box, kirkland plant 2. I thought that these 3 emails were the mostcritical because making the customer happy should be important to every company. A company would not exsist if it were not for their customers, especially loyal customers who repeatedly buyyour products. There is tons of competition out there and if a customer is unsatiffied with the product tehy are receiving then they can easily go to one of the other competitors and buy their product. That hurts us in the long run when we no long have loyal customers. Professional conduct is important in a work place. Everyone who comes to work should feel that they area respected member of a team. If an employee feels they are not being treated correctly or unhappy with how they are being treated, then that causes problems. It not only makes that employee unhappy but those around them unhappy as well. I think this ties in with professional conduct. I feel like a lot of professional misconduct happens when employees become too familiar with one another. Job rotation would eliminate some of that familiarity. Job rotation would also helpwith the process because every employee knows how to assemble the product from start to finish. It also helps when a certain team is short members. You then have others tobe substitutes. 3. I think some of the emails were definitely connected and helped handle a differentsitutation better. For example the Debbie Britzki email could have been tied in with Professional Conduct, Job Rotation and team focus. Implementing job rotation and addressing what is professional conduct in the work place could help with team focus and dealing with Debbie Britzki.

My only concern is since the software is still in the initial programming stage, there is possibility that something might go wrong. This will surely affect the productivity not only of my group, but of the whole plant. Do you have any preparedback-up plan in case something happen unexpectedly? I will be out of the office during your scheduled roll-out plan. I dont want something terrible to happen in the assembly plant while I'm out. If you can assure me that you have a ready back-up plan and things will flow smoothly while I'm out, I have no problem to start the implementation of the new software on my group per your target schedule. I will delegate one of my GL (probably, Jamie) to oversee the activities on my behalf. Pleaseinform me the details of your back-up plan within today before I give my nod on your proposal. Regards, Cory , Jamie, Our group has been chosen to be the testing site of the new Robot software. Considering your technical expertise and your willingness to improve our processes, I would like you to oversee the implementation of this new software to our group.

Did you handle each challenge in the order you received it, or did you handle them another way? Please describe your approach. As much as possible, I handleeach challengebased on itsimportancy and urgency. I tend to attend first to theemails coming from my boss Al asi assumed thosewere important and urgentto the plant operation. I attend to issues related to problemat Final Assembly as those things were also important and may needmy expertise and personal attention. If possible, I tried to delegate issues that can be solved by mygroup leader to empower them and gave mesome timefor other matter. After all important issues were address, i willgo back and check theissues thatwere delegated to ensure thattheyare properly handled. Activities thathave no direct impact to myarea of responsibilitywill be handled during my freetime. 2. Please list the major categories of issues or problems facing Final Assembly in the Bridgeport facility of Soundproof Solutions. a.Quality: Issue on warranty claim with Doxy b.Quality: NoiseBreaker Model 1 Problem c.

mJWcEzUgqFj,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Hi Alex, Thanks for bringing this up. This is a serious situation and should be dealt with immediately. Being new here, I would like to ask you a few questions - 1. Has this been a issue in the past? 2. Have we provided training to all employees about professional conduct at workplace? 3. Have we had any sexual harassment trainings here before? When was the last one? 4. Were the employees notified before hand about a tour? 5. Did Velma reach out to customers and apologize to them? Let's try to find that out. 6. Have we provided all information to all employees regarding SEQUENCE, its implementation & importance? I will talk to Velma about this in details again. Sequence is an important project and we all need to be responsible fo rits success. It cannot succeed unless all are into together. I feel we need to check if we failed in communicating SEQUENCE'S importance to employees. If anyone has any issues, concerns about SEQUENCE, they need to speak up and provide suggestions. If they are not committed they need to get off the train or disciplined. We need SEQUENCE to succeed. I will talk to line managers about cleaning the areas and keeping an eye on any litter. I will talk to the facilities to make sure the area is nice and tidy all the time, especially during customer visits. We have to engage with the workers to make sure they don't do this again. Those who repeat the mistakes again, especially the harassment, have no place in our company. I will talk to HR about more training & engagement. I assure you we will not have this problem again! I apologize for any inconvenience on behalf of my workers. Thanks, Jamie. ,",NA,"Hi Shea, Thanks for the note. Let's do it during lunch time 12 to 1 pm on April 21st. I think I will use BP07 with the round tables so teammates can interact a little better. Thanks for arranging. Regards, Jamie ,",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Paul, Thanks for sending the results. I think it was great that you were able to motivate them to do better. Looking at the results, I felt that Pat had strong leadership skills and J.J had great problem solving skills. I think they complement each other very well as a team. We need them to work with each other and learn from each other. Instead of announcing 'a'winner, I think it would be better if we shared the results with them and showed them their areas of strengths & improvement. That will motivate them further. My concern is that by announcing one winner, we might make them complacent & create unwanted rivalry between them. We need to be careful with that. Cory - please review the results with them together & make them understand how they complement each other.Both are the winners in that regard.I will buy the lunch for the other guy :)I can talk to HR and see if we can provide any development opportunitiesor training to improve their skills/weaknesses. I will talk to both of them before I depart. Thoughts? Jamie , ...I forgot to add: in the future let's be more careful about such competitions. We need HR to review these things before they can be implemented. We don't want to get in to any trouble if they take it too seriously. Performance metrics needs to be validated & analyzedby HR team. We want a healthy competition between them. Jamie.",NA,"Vic, This is a very concerning to me that you thought J.J was trying to steal company information. Have we officially communicated with all employees what they can and cannot copy from company IT system? I think it will be premature to say that J.J was trying to steal the information without talking to him. I would check with him again and understand if he was honestly trying to do some research. Please do not proceed with any paperwork until you hear from me. I would like to know his position. I will get back to you.

It is important that you provide complete and thorough answers to the questions below.  For your reference, a list of messages you received today is shown after question 4.  1. Please list the major categories of issues or problems facing Customer Service Team 5 of Soundproof Solutions. Why is each an issue or a problem? 1.customers abusing replacement policies- company is losing money 2. people disrespecting others co-workers as well as customers- one person idea of fun could be considered harrassment by others and customers should never hear you talking about them or other customers bad PR3. company policy on confidential info and its use- some info should never leave the building if lost ot stolen company info could be used to out bid or out perform the company  2. What were the three most important messages you considered the highest priorities to handle? Why?1. A salesperson complains that representatives behave unprofessionally because internal partners are our customers too 2. A security guard suspects an associate of improper activity - if no permission was obtained prior to staff taking info out of the office corrective action my need to be taken 3. A new product is faulty and will start to produce complaints in two weeks - increased work load for all until issues are all resolved.  3. List specific examples (if any) of instances where you detected a relationship between two of the messages you received in your inbox. For example, when you decided how respond to one message, did you consider information provided not only in that message, but in other message(s)? 1. A security guard suspects an associate of improper activity made me realize that Tracy Hurdle reports research on customer satisfaction info may not have been obtained with permission 4.

Cary",NA,NA,"Taylor, I think this would be a great idea. By looking at the scores he did do a good job so yes, I think he will be a fine replacement while you are out. Thank you for letting me know.

Thank you for letting me know. And I assure you it will never happen again. Thanks again, Cary","Haley, I would choose Blaine Lerner due to her scores of performance and productivity are both very high. She also has a C+ in Customer Service ratings. She does work best under supervision but there will always be someone over her to help if needed. Eden Webb also has good scores but I do not think it would be a good idea to hire someone full time into that position that has a history of being impatient and sarcastic even though she is a quick worker. Better to get the job done correct better than getting it done fast. This is definitely a tough decision due to having some good team members on my team but I feel this is the best choice in this matter. Thank you, Cary",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Can you send out an email regarding this situation. There is no need for this in the workplace. We are all grownups and this type of behavior will not be tolerated. Please assure Eluto that we are working to stop this type of behavior and we would like to handle the situation right here and not taking it as far as to HR. If this is his culture to eat this type of food then we are going to have to be accepting of this issue. Good luck in resolving this. Let me know if I can be of further help to you. Thank you Cary,NA,"Taylor, I think we should ask that Mr. Weedler pay for all of his materials ordered and if he finds that he needs a replacement roll then he will have to pay for it. We need to tell him that we are losing money on the replacement rolls. This way he will have to be certain he orders correctly on the front end. Thank you for bringin this to my attention.  Cary","Thank you for letting me know this information. I will look further into this and will talk to Tracy regarding this incident. You, although cannot go into his bag and look through his things. That is not ok to do. We will have to go through the proper channels to look into this matter before he is automatically terminated. I understand the importance of this matter but we need to do this on a professional level. He absolutely is not allowed to download these files but we need to make sure that he did not have permission to do this before we jump to any conclusions. We cannot assume anything.

Did you handle each challenge in the order you received it, or did you handle them another way? Please describe your approach. At first I handled them in order because they came slow enough and my response (email or phone) was short enough. However, as they kept coming before I was finished replying to one, I had to prioritize them.   2. Please list the major categories of issues or problems facing Final Assembly in the Bridgeport facility of Soundproof Solutions. a.) Engagement b.) Teamwork (lack thereof) c.)Personnel   3. Describe why each entry in Question 2 is an issue or problem. Engagement controls the amount of interaction, or overall morale (pride) that an individual has. Engagement affects and effects everything else in the work place; safety, efficiency, quality,continuous improvement, suggestions, progress, discipline, attendance, etc. Teamwork is also very important in the work place, especially in a non-union faciltiy. The possibilities are limited only by thewillingness of the team to implement ideas that were developed by the entire team. Personnelissues need to be addressed immediately. However, one of the emails was interpreted by me as a ""hear-say"" with ""I think it was"", or ""it sounded like..."" statements and since leaving for amy two week vacation, I had to delegate that one. The other was filed away...""for future use"", and the last one I just opened and glanced through as these emails came to me. Without personnel, there is nobody to do the job. In addition, having clear expectations and enforcing them consistently sends clear feedback to all associates.

If so, please list specific examples of theseinstances (Example: Message X related to Message Z, Company Policies related to Message Y, etc.). Obiously, the last email regarding the potential termination of J.J. Paxton can be investigated with the intent of the Victory Lunch background, and the Debby Britzki email. I have already mentioned the three emails that dealt with Engagement. I don't know how realistic this scenario is, but to be present on the first day of employment then gone for 2 weeks without having time to begin establishing rapport with anyone, it felt like my reasoning for acting the way that I did had no 'real' basis."

wsJiKqVOUWY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"J.J., Have you spoken with Debby about these concerns? If not, that would be the prudent first step. Such a conversation would need to clearly specify your expectations for Debby, and where her current tendancies may cause her to miss those marks. I would be happy to attend any such conversation if you feel my presence would add value. If you have already had such a conversation, and Debby's performance remains unchanged, then we can approach HR together. Thanks, Jamie","J.J., Perhaps we can take a different approach. Please provide me with some bullet points identifying the skillsets and number of personnel that you're seeking for your team. I will then ask HR to align those requested skillsets with any personnel that may come from Kirkland. The more specific you can be, the better. If this suggested approach doesn't allay your concerns, please let me know and we can discuss things further. But I certainly don't want to alienate folks or rule them out prematurely. Thanks, Jamie",NA,NA,NA,"Shea, Thanks for the advanced notice. I appreciate it. I'd perfer to have Al speak during the lunch timeslot. I'm hesitant to ask employees to come in before, or stay after, their shifts. It causes hardship to employees in their personal lives, and quite frankly I'm not sure if it's really warranted for this presentation. I believe XR24 will do as a meeting room. It should fit our employees sufficiently, and seems to have the necessary equipment for the ""interactive"" presentation that Al is seeking. Thank you for setting up the event. Please let me know if anything is needed from me to facilitiate its success. ...Jamie","Jennifer, I think there may be a misunderstanding regarding responsibilities. I am the Group A lead, and as such I am responsbile for driver mount, electronics installation, and trim installations. Group B handles repair (based on the materials that I have regarding structure of the working groups). If that is incorrect, please let me know. But I believe you need to speak with the Group B lead regarding the issues you noted below. Thank you, and please let me know if I can be of any further assistance. Waste reduction and elimination of inefficiency is integral to SEQUENCE's success, and I'm happy to assist where appropriate. ...Jamie",NA,"J.J., Although I certainly applaud the initiative, I'm a bit concerned about the access of company information on personal home computers. There are security issues there and we have IT policies that prohibit such steps. Further, the sharing of that business data outside of the company poses a security and business confidentiality concern. We definitely need to speak about these concerns. Please come by my office TODAY to discuss these concerns. As to placing the order, please hold off. I'm not entirely comfortable with the suggested changes yet, and need some briefing before approving the expenditure and committment. Again, I applaud the initiative. But we need to discuss how to handle these opportunities for improvement. Please see me immediately. Thank you, Jamie Pace","Isaac, Here are my most immediate concerns associated with the path suggested: - While existing software is offline for upgrade, what are the impacts to our productivity measures & tracking? I'd like to better understand the functionality of the existing software so I know what the risks are at cutover. - I'd prefer to have Shea aggregate staff reports from my Team Leads in draft format. She can then provide them to me as a single report and, after I review it, I can forward it to you as final. - There is a corporate audit scheduled for 4/18. I'd prefer to avoid interruptions to regular business continuity during the audit since auditors may confuse cutover issues with our normal processes. Cutover issues could incorrectly beperceived to be errors in our processes. Thanks, Jamie",NA,"Cory, I wanted to share this information from Paul. Obviously, Pat has some solid leadership potential. J.J. does as well. But both also have areas where they can improve. Will you be coordinating the Victory! lunch? I can offer up Shea's assistance if you'd like some help. And finally, I'd like to speak with Pat and J.J. independently about their scores BEFORE the lunch. Would you like to be a part of those conversations? Thanks, Jamie",NA,"Vic, A separate note from J.J. stated that he had removed data from the company computers so that he could work on a project with other personnel to improve turntable efficiency. I do NOT believe that J.J. had an ill-intent when he removed the information from our systems. I am not in favor of terminating J.J. today. I believe there needs to be further investigation to confirm the facts of this issue. J.J. mentioned that he was working on the project with Emily Carson. I would recommend that you and I speak with Emily to better understand the situation. I would agree that there IS a very real issue concerning the security of our business data. That issue must be discussed with J.J. However, I would recommend doing that AFTER we speak with Emily. Once we've spoken with Emily, we can decide on the message to share with J.J. However, I do not agree that J.J.'s exit from the plant is warranted at this time. There are too many unanswered questions at the moment. I have asked J.J. to stop by and discuss some of these concerns with me today. Following that discussion, you and I can chat and then meet with Emily.

To reply to the questions in these messages, simply click the Reply button above and enter your responses in the form of a reply e-mail.  1. Did you handle each challenge in the order you received it, or did you handle them another way? Please describe your approach. I tried to handle my challenges based on time-prioritization. If I had to read 2 emails prior to my next meeting, for instance, then I did so to ensure that I had the necessary knowledge. I postponed less-urgent emails/actions until after my time-constrained issues were addressed.  2. Please list the major categories of issues or problems facing Final Assembly in the Bridgeport facility of Soundproof Solutions. Personnel issues. These stem from predispositions and assumptions that the SEQUENCE process will fail, to interpersonal communication issues between team leads and employees, to employee dissatisfaction with their jobs. Too much, too fast. There may also be an issue with ""too much happening too fast"". For instance, rollout of new software upgrades and the implementation of a job rotation approach immediately preceding or during a corporate audit is not advisable. Personnel resistance to change. There seem to be a lot of ""moving parts"" and many people seem to be resistant to change with that degree of rapidity. Concerns over new processes. SEQUENCE is viewed by some as a ""flavor of the week"", or an attempt to down-size the company. These presumptions aren't necessarily reality. But people are acting in a way that are forcing these negative perceptions to become reality.  3. Describe why each entry in Question 2 is an issue or problem. SEQUENCE is an employee-oriented, bottom-up process. Without engagement by the employee for quality control, process improvements, and other continuous improvements, SEQUENCE will not work. Employees need to be ""on board"" and open-minded enough to try the process. Some (such as Alice) are...and some (such as Pat) are certainly less so. Too much, too fast"" causes employee hesitation. They feel that they are being dislodged from their comfort zones. This causes morale to decrease over time, which results in a productivity lapse.Changes in processes should be phased-in over time and in different areas to prevent overwhelmingstaff. Many people naturally resist change. But change over time is often imperceptible. Rapid, large-scale shifts will unnerve a workforce and leave them asking ""what is management thinking?!?"". When the employee workforce begins to doubt that management has a clear sense of direction, morale and productivity decrease. When employees believe that a new management technique is only a temporary fad, it results in diminished committment. Techniques such as SEQUENCE, Six Sigma, etc., are a WAY of doing things. They are as much a mental approach to efficiency as they are a process or product approach. They often rely heavily on ground-level employees to properly manage deviations from normal operations. Without 100% buy-in from those employees, it is nearly impossible to realize an optimium level of performance.

MOST...Warranty Claim...theft of company information...professional conduct. LEAST...Victory lunch...Debby Britzki...Kirkland Plant  2. Why did you feel that the e-mails you rated as most important were critical? They set the stage. The warranty claim could result in the loss of sales and the decline of the company's profits. It's a competitive market, and every lost customer will find the service they need from a competitor. The theft of company information issue was going to result in the immediate firing of a good, proactive employee for the WRONG reasons. Here was someone trying to better the organization, and they had just misstepped along the way. It was a coaching moment, not a firing one. Professional conduct and respect is integral to the workplace. No one should ever be concerned that they are going to be disrespected, disregarded, or minimized in the workplace. Basic professional courtesy will always be a mandate to me. Anything less will not be tolerated.  3.Todays assessment provided you with background information about Soundproof Solutions and also presented thechallenging messages listed above. Were there situations where information from one source/challenge helped you to better understand and address anotherchallenge? If so, please list specific examples of theseinstances (Example: Message X related to Message Z, Company Policies related to Message Y, etc.). Yes. For instance, knowing that there was an audit scheduled for 4/18 allowed me to set a deadline for Robin to optimize her team's work and also for to address the housekeeping issues in the Trim line. The audit date established a timeline, and also provided signifiance as to why immediate follow up was warranted. It struck me as odd when I was advised not to let the audit play a part in the roleplays. In the real work environment, there are often synergies that should be recognized. This was one."

Please work with Velda to ensure that the customer is ordering the correct amount and if there is an issue with next weeks order, let me know as soon as I return. , Velma, Taylor has identified a concern that Weeler Contracting is underestimating the amount of quietPAPER required for jobs on a regular basis and looking for us to provide 'replacement' rolls to make up the difference. Can you please work with Taylor and Weeler on the order for next week to ensure that this is not repeated. Any concerns can be raised with Haley Roth in my absence. Cary.","Laing, As stated in my voicemail, Tracy did send me a note with regards to a presentation that he made to a Statistics class that is being taken on his own time. I have already left avoicemail for Marge on the issue and I need to understand the policies around this issue prior to action being taken. Cary ,","Responses; 1 - The major categories are Customer Satisfaction,TeamworkandLeadership. Customer Satisfaction: There have been several complaints that seem to have the quantity of the work put above the quality. The team needs to have some guidance on how to balance the two in order to provide the best service to the customers. Teamwork: Issues do not get addressed between the various departments. Leadership: The two coordinators seem to be very negative with Taylor pointing a lot of fingers. Coaching is required to improve the morale of the group for both the coordinators and the representatives. 2. The most important messages were; The security concern with Tracy Hurdle - If the representative was in violation of the corporate policy on confidential material then HR needed to get involved immediately. Fletcher Systems - A directive was provided by the Vice President of Sales that had not been actioned in a timely manner. Problem with Your Paint - The meeting and resulting action with Kendall Wilson required a timely resolution for the paint spill 3. There were several instances; Eluto Caplanu / Jess Rollins meeting/ Professional Conduct / Problem with your PAINT / any e-mail from Taylor Slade - all identified communication issues by the team either within the department as well as internal / external customers. Notes from Barney / Promotion - identified the previous focus on quantity of calls over quality. Meeting with Cyd Atkins / Installation Scheduling - identified the tension between the teams Meeting with Cyd Atkins / Installation Scheduling / Paperless Office / Task Force/ Database update recommendation- identified the fact that the current database is not meeting the needs of the organization and needs to be evaluated. I would want to see the results of the paperless office and bring my concerns to Haley on my return. 4. I would have liked to have had; access to previous performance appraisals for all of the staff a price list of the products / installation fees in order to understand the magnitude of several issues access to the HR policies and procedures an opportunity to meet with my coordinators at the beginning of the day"

I did bounce a few times if I saw something that I thought was more important.   2. Please list the major categories of issues or problems facing Final Assembly in the Bridgeport facility of Soundproof Solutions. Team leaders need training and direction then I would re-evaluate the Lead positions to make sure I have the right people. Communications seems to be an issue in management and between employees. Management is not leading by example and some transparency would help to push the SEQUENCE program.   3. Describe why each entry in Question 2 is an issue or problem. Team leaders need to be what their title is...TEAM LEADS. Employees look at leaders as the pace setters of company policy. Bad attitudes and personal agendas lead others in the wrong direction. Management is responsible to communicate with new personel and team leads to correct small issues before they get out of hand. They are also responsible to provide others(Team Leaders/new hires)with the tools they need to succeed."

I would much rather have sufficient time to discuss this information with you and review the report in detail before implementing anything. So let's hold off on starting that right now. I would much rather have this reviewed and discussed with you prior to presenting something to Haley. When I return from vacation, we will schedule a time to go over this information together. Make sure to always get permission before using any company information or presenting company information outside of work. We will discuss everything once I return to work that week. Thanks, Cary Stevens Customer Support Leader for Soundproof Solutions",NA,NA,"Taylor, After reviewing the information, I do not feel we should do this at this time. There are several area where he excels very well, but then some areas that are just as important, he does not. These duties should be as close to an ideal coordinator in all areas, not just in an overall score. Thanks, Cary",NA,"Haley, After reviewing the scores for each employee, I do agree that Blaine Lerner would be our top candidate. Each person has their own strong points, but after reviewing Blaine's scores, Blaine seems to be the most balanced between both areas of assessment. The Productivity Index for Blaine exceeds beyond the company's standard, as well as the Performance Index score for Blaine is the highest of any of the other empoyees. I choose Blaine for the promotion from temporary part time to transition to the full time position that is currently available. If you have any issues or concerns, please let me know. Thanks, Cary Stevens Customer Support Leader for Soundproof Solutions",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Taylor, While I agree that Mr. Weedler's requests for replacement rolls, does seem excessive compared to our other customers, we still need to take all of the information into consideration: *Mr. Weedler currently uses Soundproof Soultions exclusively *We have had 14 orders from him in the past year *He stated the customer ""might"" complain ( what he sees in the paper, the customer may not-should the customer complain, we should replace the product ) *Mr. Weedler is the president of the local Home Contracting Association. But assuming he is telling all the other contractors to request free replacement rolls is not a fact. You said Mr. Weedler is planning on placing another order next week. Let's see how that order is handled and if a free replacement roll is requested and for what reason. In the meantime, I want you to work on two things for me: 1) Gather a report for the past year of replacement rolls by Contractor, reason for replacement, and number of requests. In the report, also include whether or not the same item was requested for replacement by other Contractors as well. We may find that other Contractors may have the same issues as Mr. Weedler that way we can determine if it's more of a product quality issue we need to be aware of vs. Mr. Weedler. 2) Then gather a report specifically for Mr. Weedler's requests. So, for right now, go ahead and replace the requested roll for Mr. Weedler. This will give us time to gather our information and facts for review. We would not want to lose a valuable customer over our mishandling or assumptions of their business with us without showing we have investigated the issue as well. Ashley, you did a great job on reporting this. We appreciate your hard work. Taylor, let me know when the reports have been generated so I can review. Haley, I included you in this response email so you could be aware of this issue and what we are doing to come to a resolution at this time. If anyone has any questions, please let me know.

Your answers to these questions will help in the evaluation of your performance by providing a better understanding of your approach and rationale. It is important that you provide complete and thorough answers to the questions below.  For your reference, a list of messages you received today is shown after question 4.  1. Please list the major categories of issues or problems facing Customer Service Team 5 of Soundproof Solutions. Why is each an issue or a problem? There is a breakdown in communication tat needs to be addressed and this will ultimately be vital to the company's success if not handled as soon as possible. It seems as though there have been far too many dissatisified customers recently  Also there are major customer service issues and professionalismthat need to be  addressed 2. What were the three most important messages you considered the highest priorities to handle? Why? Customer service issues-impacts the company as a whole and with it's success or failure. The Coordinators under me, do not seem to be qualified for their jobs, as they lack the customer service skills and professionalism needed for a position in that form. Inaccurate information-the CSR's mostly gave inaccurate information about the products or company more than they gave accurate info.  3. List specific examples (if any) of instances where you detected a relationship between two of the messages you received in your inbox. For example, when you decided how respond to one message, did you consider information provided not only in that message, but in other message(s)? The issues about employees disregard or lack of knowledge of company policies, lack of professionalism by talking about another co-worker as well as a customer. I addressed all issues in one group email.  4. Describe what additional information you would have liked to have in order to have a better or clearer understanding of the messages and challenges presented to you today. I believe the information was detailed enough."

If there are issues that need to be handled, we will deal with them. How long has the absenteeism been an issue? Can you send me a record of dates she has missed, or been late? I think the best course of action would be talking to her about the absenteeism and explain that showing up late and constant calling in will not be tolerated. As for the quality issue, some retraining may help. If that does not help, we may have to put her on a job where the quality is not so important, or even remove her from production. Please get me records, and when I return from vacation I will cover them with her in a coaching session. Until that time, sit her down and discuss the issues with her, then start the retaining.

Please list the major categories of issues or problems facing Final Assembly in the Bridgeport facility of Soundproof Solutions.  Older employees who do not like change. Professional conduct. Quality of the products.  3. Describe why each entry in Question 2 is an issue or problem. Older employees tend to stay with what they know. They will reject new ideas and improvements in the process sometimes. Professional conduct can hurt the company in large ways, such as the tour. If the wrong person sees or hears the wrong thing, the company could loose a large buyer. Product quality is probably the most important. Its an issue of cost. Redoing a job, refunds, wasted material, wasted man hours. Quality can kill a company. Most important were the Turn tables, Professional conduct, and Warranty claim. Least important were, Kirkland plant, Debby Britzki, and Suggestion box. I felt that these were the most important because they all relate to immediate quality and sales issues. Selling quality products is the most important thing for any company. The issues approached by the ""Warranty claim"" email was given light by the ""Theft of company information"" and ""SEQUENCE talk"" These 2 emails showed that employees were either distracted, or unhappy.

Why did you feel that the e-mails you rated as most important were critical? I believe that the most important emails stated above are the ones that need decision making at that time. Personal conduct of the production team that is seen by the customer must be addressed asap. Upgrades on IT must be replied as well since if I did not reply, there's a chance that the whole operation will shutdown for a day of the system update. Lastly, job rotation is also important to me since this affects the employees, which will result to decrease in efficiency and performance of our production if they are not ready or well-equiped to take the new role in the job rotation.  3.

Were there situations where information from one source/challenge helped you to better understand and address anotherchallenge? If so, please list specific examples of theseinstances (Example: Message X related to Message Z, Company Policies related to Message Y, etc.). Yes. One example is the meeting with Mel Chang. There is an email fromPat regarding what happened during the rejects of unit. He gave a background on the type of person and that she has a friend, Shirley working with the competitor. Al, the General Manager and Shea, the administrative assistant helps as well by reminding the things to do, which Paul left. Also, the employee profile andbackground information about the companyprovided is very useful especially for the table of organization.

If it was urgent - then I took care of it right away. If it could wait until the end of the day - I would make a task and get to it later.  2. Please list the major categories of issues or problems facing Final Assembly in the Bridgeport facility of Soundproof Solutions. Personnel - Robin, Pat, and JJ all have issues Initiativerollout - SEQUENCE doesn't seem to be implemented consistently Focus - multiple people driving in different directions without communicating to one another. 3. Describe why each entry in Question 2 is an issue or problem.  Personnel - the team leads need further training for different reasons - one in relating to employees (Robin), the other in relating to management (Pat). JJ's performance is not focused where it needs to be. He may be violating company policies. He probably needs disciipline Initiative rollout - Robin doesn't want to wait for everyone else to catch him on SEQUENCE, or his better ways to improve. Pat doesn't agree and implied that the peoplein charge didn't talk to employees about the initiative Focus - Job rotation, individual areas trying to improve their process without the entire line understanding changes, Paul's leadership survey, no leadership development for team leads in the area, complaints about absenteeism - without evidence of it.

If not, I placed the email at the bottom of the screen as a reminder while I did my research and prepared a response.  2. Morale being down Poor Communication  Total buy-in to SEQUENCE not happening 3.Morale  The frame of mind and happiness of a companys employees will be directly related to how well a company performs. Making sure they know exactly what we want to do , how to do it safely and efficiently and showing them that their time and opinion matters will keep morale high.  Communication  Most of the people that I interacted with simply did not know anything was going wrong or didnt know what SEQUENCE was all about and how important it was to the company.  Total buy-in to SEQUENCE not happening  Its difficult to get people to change or accept change such as SEQUENCE. More time and effort may need to be put into rolling out a new way of doing business like SEQUENCE. There were Leads that werent leading by example and driving their Team to follow the new program. All levels of the company must day in and day out reinforce their belief in the program for it to become a new way of life or create longevity within the company.

IDuOkXJhMti,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Tracy, I have a few thoughts on your work in this area. First, I commend you on continuing your education. Regarding how we might use this data, we have been authorized by Haley to use up to $250 per month as an incentive bonus to improve quality and productivity. I would like to ask you to incorporate into your process a $125 monthly bonus for each team to be awarded to the team member with the highest productivity - but with a minimum performance index as well. We should strive to improve both quality and quantity with this process. Please be thinking about this, and bring some recommendations to me upon my return from vacation. Lastly, please remember to follow relevant company policy in regards to the security of company data and other assets when working on this project. Thank you,",NA,NA,"Taylor, I concur with your recommendation, and believe that Jerry should be given this opportunity. Please remind Jerry that your team members will be grading his performance, so equitable and fair decision making is of paramount importance. Please keep me informed in regards to Jerry's development and performance. Thank you. Cary",NA,"Haley, I believe that we should pursue the promotion of Blaine Lerner to full time status. He has the best performance index among the TPT reps, along with a productivity index that exceeds company standards. Additionally, based on notes that Barney left, I believe that Blaine would have been Barney's choice as well. Thank you, Cary",NA,NA,"Haley, I would like to suggest the following: Tracy Hurdle, asthey have met the training prerequisites, have a solid performance record, and has been a solid employee. As a person of varied interests, Tracy will be able to relate well to a variety of commercial customers. Sandy Martin, as they have met the training prerequisites, have a solid performance record, and has been a solid employee. Sandy has proven to be a quick study, accomplishes tasks with ease, and has excellent computer skills. Lastly, Jess Rollins, as this employee has a solid performance background and needs employee developement opportunities. Jess will need to be scheduled for all three core courses to be elegible. Thank you,",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Taylor, In the future, I believe that we should request that Mr. Wheedler return any defective products to us, at our expense. This would be an appropriate response to this situation given the commercial customer replacement policy. If Mr. Wheedler continues to experience problems with our products, please let me know so that we can more thoroughly address the issue. Thank you for bringing this to my attention. Regards, Cary","Liang, Thank you for your concern, however Tracy is working on a special project regarding customer satisfaction, and is using statistical data from our server as input into the project. Regards, Cary","1. Please list the major categories of issues or problems facing Customer Service Team 5 of Soundproof Solutions. Why is each an issue or a problem? - Predecessor may not have clearly communicated expectations required for adavncement - employees can become dissillusioned -Predecessor/Coordinator may not have communicated positive feedback to CSRs - decreases employee morale -A few instances of unprofessional behavior were noted - negatively impacts employee morale and customer opinion -possible data security issue with downloaded data used in educational environment, however I am not sure of relevant policy/procedure in this area for the ecercise. There would be potential privacy/security problems. -Predecessor didn't act on employee performance improvement bonus program - implementation should boost employee performance and productivity -There was a lack of team spirit/customer centric outlook on the part of the Installation Leaders, which ulitimately leads to decreased customer satisfaction. Cyd should be encouraged to ""join the team"", which may require Director level coaching and intervention. 2. What were the three most important messages you considered the highest priorities to handle? Why? 1. Fletcher Systems - direct customer intervention 2. Kendall Wilson - direct customer intervention, possible additional large commercial business 3. Professional Conduct and Eluto Caplanu tied - both affect customer opion and employee morale 4. all of the employee developement emails 3. List specific examples (if any) of instances where you detected a relationship between two of the messages you received in your inbox. For example, when you decided how respond to one message, did you consider information provided not only in that message, but in other message(s)? There were many inter-related emails in the exercise. I relied on ""Some of Barney's files"" for all of the employee developement issues, advancement issues, Jess' meeting, etc. The QuietPAPERONE issue was relevant to the scheduling of the PAPERLESS OFFICE project, and there were many other relationships as well. 4.

They will be assessed and tested for such actions. Not knowing who we will be getting, if any, we should not judge accordingly until we know for sure and can have time to interview with them and get them trained properly.

Thanks, Jamie",NA,"Alex, Thanks for contacting me about my team. I will be sure to address this with the individuals you mentioned to get a clear picture of what happeneed and why. I will be out of the office for 2 weeks for vacation, therefore I will sit with them when I return. I will send them an e-mail in the meantime to get their details as to what happened. The plant tour last week, I did not see this on the schedule, was this planned or moments notice? I would like for these visits to be planned and prepared for. I would also like to be present for them to meet and greet and to answer any questions they may have. The visit you suggest for the 26th will not work, can we move it to the 27th.

Just coming on board and still learning the people and their work ethics, I will be sure to meet with the team Thursday 4/21/16 after my return from vacation. I know this is important and I will be sure the team talks about the production levels and the repair concerns. I noticed on your sheet that Larry was only out for 2 days, however there were more than a half a dozen times we had repair concerns. I also noticed that JJ substituted for many of those days and it seemed the repair concerns were worse. I need to talk with JJ to get a feel for his apptitude to fill in for absentee workers.

Let's get together upon my return to review your information so I can make a sound decision with all involved. As I am just coming on board with the company and project, I will have a learning curve no doubt. Thanks for your patience and I will contact you when I return to the office. Feel free to e-mail while I am out and I will respoind accordingly when I return as I will not have access to phones or e-mails while on vacation.

I am a bit concerned for the lunch. First I will not be here on the 7th, as I will be on vacation. Also to put team leads in direct competition maybe not a good idea. I will discuss the results with Cory and give my concerns for the competition and the lunch. Rewarding people is great, but to compare against another team player may not be the best course of motivational actions. So before I meet with JJ or Pat, I will talk with Cory. Cory, Can you resond accordingly and perhapslets delay the lunch until I return so we can sit and discuss the scenario? Thanks, Jamie",NA,NA,"For the most part, the e-mails were handled in order, but I did not feel the need to address them that way. I tried to choose the most important and the ones that needed immediate attention. It seems that team work, moraland relations need to be better implemented for the team. Just coming on board, I would need to gain the confidence of the team by leading by example and to be sure to listen and take action for all concerns. Keeping upfront and keeping fresh the concept of the SEQUENCE can work if all are participating. New and tenured employees need to work together. Meeting often to discuss all topics is important, communication is key for all to participate to deliver quality and customer service.

I went through most of the emails and replied to them in an order that was best suited for me. I read each issue then when i came up with a reply thats when i got back to the sender. 2.) One major issue is that Trim Install Leader J.J. Paxton was just terminated from his job. Another issue would be to find a way to get all employees on board with the new SEQUENCE program. J.J. Paxton being terminated provides a challenge now where he will need to be replaced. Getting everyone on board with the SEQUENCE program is very important because it could fail if everyone does not do their part.Original Message----- From: Assessment Administrator Sent: 4/5/2016 12:31 PM To: Pace, Jamie Cc: Subject : About your day (1 of 2)  This e-mail and the one that follows contain some final questions for you.

Thank you, Cary Stevens","Haley, After reviewing the performance index data, the performance index data, and the employee files, I have determined that Ashley Payne should be given the full time position. This decision was made using the following reasoning: 1. She has a 84% performance index indicating that while she is not yet the ""ideal"" representative, she is within the boundaries of acceptible performance. 2. Her productivity is well above the company standard, and I believe that she can be coached to produce less, in order to improve the quality of her performance. 3. She has demonstrated that she is an excellent worker and dedicated to achieving her all. This position will give her the opportunity to use her established knowledge of our products and services which will be an asset to our team. Please let me know if you have any further questions.

Thank you, Cary Stevens",NA,"Taylor, Before we jump to conclusions on Weedler Contracting, let's try to implement our replacement policy for our commercial customers. We don't ask the customer to return the defective product for one unit; however, evidence supports Weedler Construction has asked for a replacement for several products. While these might have been for different orders, I believe we can implement our policy and ask for the defective product to be returned at our expense so we can conduct a quality review. We want to assure Mr. Weedler that our goal is to make sure he is receiving a quality product everytime. His compliance with returning the defective product will assist us in determining how to better serve him in the future. I believe this course of action will put a stop to any misuse of the policy.

I will set up a meeting today to duscuss these issues with J.J. to get a path forward. Jamie,  I think you should be aware that last week when I was walking by your area, I observed J.J. Paxton downloading files from a computer onto a disk and putting the disk in a knapsack.  When J.J. went to lunch, I removed the disk from the knapsack and examined it. I found that it contained detailed data on our operations. It was definitely company confidential information.  I confronted J.J., who claimed that it was just research on a shop floor issue that he was working on in his off time. Frankly, it sounded like he was trying to think of an excuse as fast as he could.  After having some time to think about it, I decided that I would confront J.J. and escort him from the building by the end of the shift today. Then Ill get the paperwork going to have J.J. officially terminated. I thought you might want to know.

Morale, absenteeism, conflicts betweenemployees, communication issues between management and the work force  3. Describe why each entry in Question 2 is an issue or problem. Morale is an issue due to the fact if there is an unhappy work force there is no loyalty to the company which in turn affects produtivity. Absenteeism in the work force causes another employee to take the job for the employee who is gone. This can cause fatigue, which in the long run affects prductivity. Conficts between employees can lead to work force violence. This violence can put liability on the company. There has to begood lines of communication.

Management did a poor job of communicating why the change was needed.  - Management should have started sooned with their plan and definatly extended the deadline if not ready to proceed.  - Training-Training-Training.... It should never slow down or stop 3. By not doing the 3 things I mentioned above in the answer to question #2, the plant is not ready to go to the next step and definatly not ready because the workers are not ready.Original Message----- From: Assessment Administrator Sent: 4/5/2016 1:20 PM To: Pace, Jamie Cc: Subject : About your day (1 of 2)  This e-mail and the one that follows contain some final questions for you.

Rewarding employees is an excellant way to motivate and boost morale. 3. - One challenge was when the Security officer was going to terminate the employee for stealing information. While this is a very serious matter and one that shouldn't be taken lightly it just goes to show you that you can't judge a book by it's cover. Things aren't always as they seem. Always search for all the facts before making a decision that will impact others.  - Another challenge was when employees start ""tatling"" on one another. Never take for face value what one employee says about another employee. Always get to know your co-workers and that way you can de-fuse some of the rumors or just discount them. Some people make it their business to try and tear down others that have the drive and determination to excel in the work place. Most employees only have a job because they have to work, and that is fine, but as a leader you have to be able to recognize the employees that LOVE their job and want to be a positive influence to others and work hard to make something out of themselves.Original Message----- From: Assessment Administrator Sent: 4/5/2016 1:21 PM To: Pace, Jamie Cc: Subject : About your day (2 of 2)  Following are some of the e-mails that you received today, along with some questions about how you approached them.

What I would like to do is set up a meeting with you, Debby and I and HR. So that we can talk through the performance issues that we are having with Debby. Instead of just moving her I would like to address some of her issues and try and resolve them so that she can be a more productive employee. Can you please have Debby come and talk to me sometime today, and then set up a meeting with HR when I get back from vacation. Thanks, Jamie","JJ I understand your concern and I agree with you that the higher quality employee we start with the faster we can teach them what they need to know. I will talk with HR and see if we have that option. That being said all the employee's from the Kirkland plant are employees of Sound Solutions. If we are not able to pick employess we will accept whomever we recieve and train them to the best of our ability. No one is beyond learning, but if we start with an attitude like that when we recieve them we will not be sucessful in training them. Thanks, Jamie",NA,"Alex, I understand you concern with what happened on the plant tour. I agreee they are a great way to show off our company. However I cannot disipline individuals based on what someone thinks happened or blame someone because they have had issues in the past. I will look into the issue and if I can find more concrete evidance of what occured I will follow up. I will alsoprovide a general reminder to our workforce that plant tours are important and that we should be mindful of what is said all the time but specifically what plant tours are being conducted. I appreciate you bringing this issue to my attention. Thanks, Jamie",NA,Please notify the work force that the meeting will be held on the 21th. Also the time should be from 12-1pm in room BP07. Please make sure that lunch is provided and the work force is notified ahead of time that lunch will be provided. I also return from vacation on 20th. Please make sure I have a copy of the presentation to be by that date so i can review prior to our meeting. I would also like Emily Carson to review since she leading the sequance rollout.,"When you work through your problem on the trim install for Doxy please make sure you use this information. The two things that I would like to see done are: When someone is sick please use others such as Robin Moskowitz to fill in. I would like you to remain as a leader to oversee the process. I know it is hard sometimes to keep for doing the work but leaders are imporatant as well and the data seems to show this. Also we need to capitilize on Larry's strengths maybe he can help you develop a tranning program for the rest of the employess so that we can improve performance. Thanks, Jamie",NA,"JJ It sounds as if you have a great idea to help the trim install in line 1. Since it sounds like these devices are low cost. What I would like to do it is instead of waiting for me to come back I would like to order one of these units and place them in service. I would like to evaluate how well the device works and present a business case for instillation of the rest of the units. Please develop a plan for this and send it back to me before the end of the day so we can get this change going forward, while you work on this plan please make sure we are following the sequence process. Thank you for all the hard work so far this sounds like it has the potential to be very helpful. Thanks, Jamie","I am ok with this plan. I do request that when i come back from vacation on April 20th, you set up a meeting with me so that we can review how the work that has been done while I was going went. Thanks, Jamie",NA,"Cory, Please announce Pat Landis as the winner. He did a great job. I had a discussion with Pat earlier today about SEQUENCE and asked for his support. He had some concerns about SEQUENCE most of which I was able to address. It does should like he has so great ideas to improve SEQUENCE I think that would be a great thing for you and Pat to discuss during the lunch.

Instead of moving her so quickly, let me talk with her and see if I can get to the bottom of some of these issues. I will set up a meeting with her before I leave for vacation and I will get back with you on the 20th when I return. Thanks, Jamie","J.J., Unfortunately, we probably won't be able to pick and choose who we get. Keep in mind that in order for SEQUENCE to be successful here, we have to work with everyone, and that even means working with people who might havesome challenges with technology :) Thanks, Jamie",NA,NA,NA,"Shea, Please set the meeting up in: BP07: 8 round tables, 36 chairs, projector, screen, flip chart - this will give us enough room for everyone along with a few extra chairs. Also, let's schedule this for 7-8am before the shift begins. Thanks again for setting this up, Jamie","Jennifer, Thank you for this information. Can you please also send me April's numbers when you get it? I am leaving for vacation tomorrow and will be returning on April 20th. I do agree that the one day Larry was not on the line the repairs do go up, but I'm also seeing a couple of different trends. I'll be the one to track those down and I'm going to do a little more research before jumping to any conclusions with this data. Thank you for the help, Jamie",NA,"J.J., I think that's great that you took the lead on this, but before we go purchasing the new turntable I would like to have a meeting with you to discuss this. I understand that it will put the project a couple of weeks behind, but I just want us to go over it and you get me up to speed with everything before we move forward. Have you done any sort of cost analysis on this? Do you know how much time/money it will save us? We'll need to make sure that the cost of the turntables won't overshadow the cost savings for us. Also, I'm not sure if you had talked to Paul about this before, but next time you decide to take things home to work on them or get other people (especially from outside of the company) to look at this, you need to let me know first. I actually had someone tell me today that they thought you were stealing company information, which could get you in a lot of trouble, which I don't want to see happen. Thanks, Jamie","Isaac, Please work with Robin, Pat, and J.J. to start this process as I am leaving for vacation tomorrow and won't return until April 20th. Pat - take the lead and put together the list of issues that we have during this time so we can send the final report back to Isaac by April 22nd. Robin, Pat, and J.J. - make sure to let your folks know what's coming their way, make sure they're prepared for this. Isaac, I look forward to meeting you too. I'll get in touch when I get back from vacation. Thanks, Jamie",NA,"Cory, I know that this lunch is supposed to take place on the 7th, but I think you and I need to sit down and talk about these results before we declare a 'winner.' I've looked at the attachment and even though Paul says that Pat is the clear winner, when I look at what he excels in and what he could use some help with, I""m not sure I can clearly say that he is a better team leader than J.J. They both excel in different areas, but I think things such as 'displays extensive knowledge of product line' should be one of the top characteristics for a team leader, and obviously Pat struggles in this area. I'm also concerned that Pat goes beyond limits of his own authority. The other thing that I am seeing by a quick glance is thatJ.J. is actually closer to the 'ideal leader' in 6 out of the 11 metrics, so wouldn't he actually be considered the winner? Please, let's at least postpone the lunch until after I'm back from vacation and you and I have a chance to sit down and talk about these results. Thanks, Jamie",NA,"Vic, Don't escort J.J. out today! He really was working on the shop floor issue from home. He sent me an email earlier this morning and told me about it. If you want to set up a meeting to dissucs this, I'm ok with that. I will be leaving for vacation tomorrow and will return on April 20th. Thanks, Jamie","1. No, I didn't handle them in the order I received them. I looked at the subjects to see what I thought was most important and started from there. I typically would read the emails from my boss first before going to another. And if I could let his emails go to the back burner to answer a more important one, I would do so. 2. Driver Mount - Robin Moskowitz - morale/productivity of his line Pat Landis - SEQUENCE J.J. Paxton - trim install repair numbers for March 3. Driver Mount - this is an issue because with morale being so low on that line there are a lot of people calling in sick, absenteeism is high and that means production is low. This can drive up the cost of your product because not only is production low, but it could also be bad quality if they are not paying attention to the job because they don't want to be there. Pat Landis - SEQUENCE is something that Bridgeport is wanting to use thoughout the plant and when there is a group of people who are not on board then that could cause the whole program to lose focus. J.J. Paxton - it seems as though when J.J. is filling in for someone on the line the trim install repair numbers go high. It looks as though J.J. is not paying attention and losing focus. This could lead to injuries, higher costs per unit, and low quality work.Original Message----- From: Assessment Administrator Sent: 4/5/2016 1:20 PM To: Pace, Jamie Cc: Subject : About your day (1 of 2)  This e-mail and the one that follows contain some final questions for you.

Theft of company information: J.J. Paxton is suspected of stealing company-confidential information: This was important because someone could have lost their job because not all of the information was gathered Warranty claim: Request for a plan to investigate warranty claims for a customers new units This could cost the company money and without more orders, the company could downsize and people could lose their jobs. They need to put out a good/reliable product and be in competition with their competitors or they'll eventually have to close their doors. Team focus: Data indicate higher error rates when the team lead cant support the group This too costs the company money.

I will begin by reviewing her attendance and see if we truly have a problem there. I will call her in to discuss the issues after I get her absenteeism report. Are you able to provide me with any insight as to why she may be missing work or arriving late? Thanks, Jamie ,","J.J., I have not heard about that, so I can't say if it si true or not. I do not think we will be able to pick and choose if that is the case. I am concerned about your views on the potential employees. I think we could provide them with ample training to bring them up to speed. If this does occur, I want you to do your best to welcome them into our plant and get them on board with SEQUENCE. They may very well have some good ideas from their past experiences. Thanks, Jamie ,",NA,"J.J., Please read over the comments we received about Trim Install and the conduct there. I would like for you to talk with your team and let them know that this behavior is not professional and could lead to ta loss of business. I am going to plan to be in the area when the next tour takes place so I can see for myself how everyone behaves. As you can seem there were also some housekeeping issues during the tour. I also expect that you will correct any housekeeping issues immediately not just when tours are taking place.

I have reviewed the data you provided and while I agree that errors go up when Larry is gone, I also see that the same can be said when most of the others are gone. I hope as we get on board with SEQUENCE that we will have fewer absences and will have to rely less on managers to work the lines. I do think it would be a good idea to provide the backup workers with some refresher training on the jobs they fill in on with the hopes of reducing errors. I will work out some training plans when I return from vacation. Thanks, Jamie ,",NA,"J.J., I want to thank you for bring up this opportunity for improvement. I am glad you are embracing SEQUENCE. I do think we should make sure to follow the SEQUENCE principles and make sure we run this past engineering before we proceed. I want you to set up a meeting with Carson to review the proposal. Make sure we get a buy in from engineering. I believe for SEQUENCE to be successful we have to follow all of the steps. Thanks again, Jamie , Vic and Karen, This is the email I received from J.J. concerning the project I mentioned in the reply to Vic's concerns. I hope it will be helpful to your investigating. It sure seems to me that J.J. was probably only trying to get on board with SEQUENCE. I was concerned about the sharing of information with a class outside of the company but figured that if it was only SEQUENCE data and not confidential information, it may have been alright.

I will be your contact in the Information Technology department. Anything to do with the programming of production machinery is handled exclusively by my team. Please let me know of any programming needs you have and I will do my best to satisfy them.  I have been talking with Al Howard about our new robot programming software. It should help make adjusting the robots and switching between programs much faster than before. Further, your team members will be able to make some adjustments to the robots directly, without involving Engineering or Maintenance. This will save both time and money, and has been approved by both Engineering and Maintenance. It is definitely very different from the current software in place. Al agreed that your group will be the test site for the entire company as we try to get the software finalized.  Here is the rollout plan I propose. Please note these dates.  Friday April 15: Install the software. We will need a full day to install and configure the software. The installation is automated, and will be done over the networkno one will need to go to your plant. However, we will need to take the current system down while we do this. We will remove your existing software at this time as well, since we are replacing it.  April 18-22: Your staff will use the software and report any issues to you. You will send the reports to me and I will act on them.  April 25-29: We will make changes to the software to correct problems found by your team.  May 2: We will officially roll out the new software for your team to use.  Week of May 2-6: We will train your team on using the software now that it is complete.  I talked this over with your team leaders and they had no concerns, but they asked that I take it up with you to confirm that we may go forward with this plan. Note that we are very flexible, so please get back to me by the end of the day with any changes you propose to make to this plan or schedule. However, Al wants to get moving within a week.   Isaac Isaac Tecniov Manager, Information Technology,",NA,"Cory, Paul sent me the attached message. I think the way Paul evaluated the results might be off a little. I don't think an average will work correctly as low scores are desired in some cases and high scores are good in others. If we evaluate each behavior for the best score, Pat won 5 categories and J.J. won 6. Given that, I think J.J. is the winner and should receive the free lunch. I will track each of them down today and share the news personally. Enjoy the meal and let me know how it goes. Thanks, Jamie ,",NA,"Vic, Thank you for bringing this to my attention. I received an e-mail earlier today from J.J. concerning this issue. J.J. mentioned working on a project and that it was discussed with members of a statistics class. I will send the e-mail to you to take a look at. J.J. mentioned that Paul Burns and Emily Carson were involved. Please investigate with Emily and find out if the story is true or not. If J.J. only review SEQUENCE data with the statistics class I am not sure any rules were broken. HR can review and make that decision. I would like the matter investigated before termination takes place. Thanks, Jamie ,","1. I did not answer them in the order they were received. I tried to determine which ones needed immediate responses and which ones could wait. 2. Teamwork, Moral 3. Teamwork- It seems that individual lines do not work well with other lines. They do not see the big picture and how each step needs to key in with the next. An example the situation with Quinn and the amplifiers causing problems for the next area. Moral- The moral of the plant seems to be down. It is leading to issues such as the one involving conduct during tours and performance on the line as in the case of the Pat Landis conversation.Original Message----- From: Assessment Administrator Sent: 4/5/2016 1:20 PM To: Pace, Jamie Cc: Subject : About your day (1 of 2)  This e-mail and the one that follows contain some final questions for you.

sHfVGBLOYSR,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Hi J.J., Thank you for the feedback, I appreciate the openess to me. Were we able to discuss this with Jamie? What was Jamie's thoughts regarding this concern? I have a scheduled meeting this Jamie today and I can discuss this with her. But if you would like to discuss this between you and me, we can set a meeting 2 weeks from today? I'd really like to get more details about this and would like to give the best win-win solution for all of us. Thank you very much. Best regards, Cory ,","Hi J.J., Thanks for letting me know about this concern. For the folks that we'll be absorbing from Kirkland, I would suggest we conduct an assessment and core training for them first. That will help us decide to which line and role we can assign them too. I have a feeling that your concern may be the same concern of the other teams here in our company. But we need to be fair with the folks from Kirkland, we need to give them a chance to gain knowledge first (the core skills) then assess which is the best line/team to assign them. I believe this will also be fair to the rest of our teams here. We'll add this up to our next team meeting to get the inputs from our teammates. Thank you. Best regards, Cory ,",NA,NA,NA,"Hi Shea, Thanks for letting me know. Yes, I would like to join this session. Can I still be booked to the 7am session? Let's use this conference room so we can accommodate more folks in a session: BP07: 8 round tables, 36 chairs, projector, screen, flip chart Perhaps after Al's session, I can schedule a meeting with the team depending I guess on the folks' reactions or questions during the session. Thank you very much. Best regards, Cory ,","Hi Jennifer, Thank you for this feedback. Let me review and discuss this first with my Trim Install Lead. Once we have come up with some recommendations and/or solutions, we'll share that to you. Thank you very much. Best regards, Cory ,  Hi JJ, I would like to ask for your help if you can review this together with the team. We need to come up with our corrective and preventive actions on how to lower down our Repairs. I would like to get that update next week, send it to me via email so I can read it will I'm out. Or we can schedule a meeting with the Quality Processes team when I get back, 20th of April. Thank you. Hi Emily, I would like to ask for your help and participation if you can attend this meeting to be set by JJ? It would be great if you are there so we can align our Trim Install Processes to what you have - in case there's a gap, we can fix it and will address the rise of repairs. Your thoughts? Thank you very much in advance. Best regards, Cory",NA,"Hi JJ, Process improvement is very much welcomed in our organization - that results to better output and happier co-workers and customers. Sure, we can discuss this further and I can set up a meeting with you and the rest of the folks you've mentioned so we can review in details. How's 2pm on the 25th of April, are you okay with that? Once I get your sign off, I will send a calendar invite. By the way, I would just like to remind you about sharing vital information about our operations and processes to non-SoundProof Solutions people. We should always put in mind the risk of these information reaching our competitors. It's fine to ask help, but I would rather seek that within the team or company first than with the outsiders - just to protect our technology and processes. I know for sure you are aware of the negative impact this may bring not just to you and me, but also to the whole organization. If you have other concerns about this, feel free to approach me and I can discuss further with you. Best regards, Cory ,  Hi Vic, Sharing this info with you regarding your email about ""Theft of Company Information"". You may find this useful when probing the concern you raised... I just hope you consider this before you raise a formal concern to our HR team. I am not saying I am taking JJ's side, just wanting to make you aware of this helpful information so you can come up with the best and appropriate judgement before taking the next course of action. Thank you very much. Best regards, Cory","Hi Isaac, Thank you for this information... this is definitely good to know. As for your proposal, is it a must todo it to all employees at the same time? I mean, can we at least do it to half of the team per Area so that it won't disrupt our daily operations and output. Then if there are potential issues be encountered, the whole productionline will not be affected. And for the date of installation, can your team do that on a weekend - since there won't be any production on weekends, nobody will be disrupted? Thank you very much. Best regards, Cory ,",NA,"Hi Jamie, This is a good way to gauge the current skill level of our team members.. hope we can do this to the rest as well. For the reward, I assume it was properly communicated to the two of them when it comes to the criteria. If yes, then I believe it should go to Pat. However, just so JJ won't feel bad about this, I would suggest we treat him for lunch as well. I guess we'll just give Pat an extra dessertor an extra pie? :) I think that's a win-win solution. If the budget is an issue, you can split the bill with me. Best regards, Cory ,",NA,"Hi Vic, Thank you for letting me know about this concern. But haveyou reported this to HR?If not, please do send a report to them copying me(so they'll know I'm already aware of it). I'll leave the investigation to HR so that I won't be biasedsince JJ's reportingto me. However,once the report has been sent to HR, I will ask JJ about the history of what happened so that at least, I have an idea what took place during that time. Thank you.

To reply to the questions in these messages, simply click the Reply button above and enter your responses in the form of a reply e-mail. 1. Did you handle each challenge in the order you received it, or did you handle them another way? Please describe your approach. Yes, I received them according to the Agenda given to me earlier this morning. For my approach, itwas good to know whoare the characters I'll be talking to. So when the related email comes in, I would know what to prioritize for reading and help me a bit to prepare.  2. Please list the major categories of issues or problems facing Final Assembly in the Bridgeport facility ofSoundproof Solutions. A. No Complete buy in from some employees in executing the SEQUENCE initiative. B.It was not clear forsome employees in SoundProof the main objective/purpose why SEQUENCE was created - some got worried that they may lose their jobs. C. Proper Turnover of the Predecessor to the incoming Area Manager or the Final Assembly  3. Describe why each entry in Question 2 is an issue or problem. For A, it will definitely be tough to make employees execute the initiative if they fully grasp it... since there's no buy in, there's no ownership. For B, it caused some misinterpretation and resulted to poor engagement and performance from the employee. If there's no direction, the whole organization won't be able to achieve the ultimate Goal/s. For C, It will be difficult for the current Area Manager to keep up with the existing action items or programs created by his/her predecessor if no proper turnover was provided. They may end up in accomplishing those action items/programs longers OR they will have to go back from scratch and start all over again (which still wastes time).  Hi, Please see my comments below.

Theft of Company Information - for one, this is a serious offense that may jeopardizethebusiness of the company. Second, it involves a person that may cause him his job - which also affects his family.  C.

ONTllgUSgeF,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"J.J. Thanks for raising this up. We need to make sure we are operating as a cohesive team and it sounds like maybe there is an obstable out there to doing so.Let me first start by speakingwith Debby to see what is going on. I would like to see if this is something that can becorrected. I may have some additional questions to follow back up with once I speak with Debby. I will make that a high priority once I get back on the 20th. You have my commitment to making sure that we get this resolved in the best way posssible for the team and the company, but this may take some patience. Thanks, - Jamie","Good thoughts J.J. and thanks for sharing your concern. It can always be a tricky thing to hire on new people.I don't know anything about the Kirkland situation so I can't speculate on what is going on there. If for some reason we do bring on some Kirkland folks I think we can trust our HR folks to make sure we get people with experience and qualities that we look for here at Soundproof. There will always be some training needed, but that is why we have good leads such as yourself to show them the ropes. Thanks, -Jamie",NA,"That is unfortunate. I will speak with each of these folks individually and address this immediately. Sounds like we need to get HR involved in this as well since parts of this also violate our company policy. I will follow up with Karen to get this handled. Thanks, -Jamie",NA,"Thanks Shea, I'm glad that this is on the 21st so I can participate as well. Please set it up over the lunch hour since we will be providing a meal. I want to respect everyone's time away from work hours. Please use room XR24 and arrange the tables into a big square so everyone can see eachother while talking. We really need Al to help people understand the significance of SEQUENCE and I think they will see our commitment to success by these efforts. Thanks, -Jamie","Jennifer, Thanks for sending this. It is very helpful, and as you pointed out there appears to be some trends that need to be followed up on.While I agree with you thought that not having Larry may be a source of repairs, my observation is that having J.J. Paxton as a substitute may be leading to some additional repairs. Can you please look into this further and send me a report of your findings. I'm not sure if this is a sustained trend, or if it occurredprimarily in March. Thanks, -Jamie",NA,"J.J., That is the kind of entreprenurial spirit that we strive for around here. Way to take initiative and get this started. We will need to run that by engineering before we proceed as part of the SmartChanges process so hold off just a bit before ordering. Please set up a brief 15 minute meetingthis afternoon with your team and Carson. Include me in there as well and I will follow up with him to make sure he attends. Great work. - Jamie","Isaac, I appreciate the warm welcome, and look forward to meeting you as well. The upgrades to the software sound great, and I think these types fo improvements will help us become more efficient and competitive. Good work. There is a potential conflict with taking the system down during the timeframe proposed. We need to run SEQUENCE reports from 4:30 to 5:00 on Friday the 15th. In order for us to do that effectively I propose that we start the installation of the software after 5;00. Please let me know if this will be an issue. Since I will be out of the office during that time please work with each of the team leads to make sure there is no potential impact to production. I have included them on this e-mail for reference. Thanks, -Jamie",NA,"Cory, Please see the e-mail below. Looks like Pat is the winner. Thanks for buying lunch. I will get with Pat and J.J. to let them know their individualresults. Since this survey data may create an overly competitive environment I suggest that we don't promote who the winner is, but make sure they both know they did well and keep it fun. This will help me as their Group leader to develop the areas that could be improved, and reduce the risk of damaging the team focus. Thanks, -Jamie",NA,"Vic, Let's make sure that your hunches are correct first. Pleaseset up a quick conference call this afternoon withKaren Duvalier in HR and myself to explaing the situation in more detail andstart a formal inquiry process. We don't want to fire someone for a misunderstanding, and HR needs to be involved at this point. Your dilligence in this matter is appreciated. Thanks, -Jamie","Answer1: Different order. The meeting got the highest priority when they came in. Some priority went to my boss. The rest was dependant on the time available and the thought it would require. Answer2: Management Issues, Personell issues, Quality /Production Issues Answer3: Management Issues - There were issues with Paul, Jamie's predesessor and how he interfaced with some of the leads (particularly Quinn). There were also some issues with Cory Manning. He seems to have some bad ideas which are not helping the situaton. Most of the leads don't fully buy into the SEQUENCE initiative. Personell Issues - There were issues with security thinking they were going to fire someone on their own, people being harrassed out in the plant and making fun of the initiatives, and not on their best behavior when a customer is present. Quality/Production issues - We have a lot of scrap, re-work, and still have returned items or defects out in the field. This is unacceptable and needs to take a higher priority over the number of items produced (in the short term).Original Message----- From: Assessment Administrator Sent: 4/5/2016 2:20 PM To: Pace, Jamie Cc: Subject : About your day (1 of 2)  This e-mail and the one that follows contain some final questions for you.

It sounds like that is what every other group has done, is simply move Debby in stead of trying to understand what the issues are and trying to help her resolve them. We need to meet with Debby to find out why she has bad days and why she is absent so often. If it is a personal issue the company can help her with, we need to do so. Pushing her off on yet another group will not help Debby or the company. We will set up a time to meet with Debby as soon as I am back from vacation.

However, even if we are allowed to hand pick1 or 2, I don't think we would be able to hand pick all. We must accept what is best for the company overall and work with it.

qHcTuHilush,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"JJ, I appreciate your candor regarding Debby. However, simply moving her to another team seems like a short term solution and does not address the problem, especially for our area as a whole. Have you spoken with Debby about what she is struggling with? If not, i would have you talk to her in private to see what is going on. If there are specific issues she is having (with training or the structure of the job) we can address them. As for her absenteeism, i will contact HR to get a handle on our policies and or appropriate course of action. In the meantime i would encourage you to try maintain a positive dialogue with Debby when she makes mistakes or seems to be having a bad day. I will follow up with you when i return from vacation on this issue. Thanks, Jamie","JJ, I appreciate your input on this. I haven't gotten all the information on if and when this will happen. However, it is important that we go through our intracompany hiring process in accordance with our policies. Simply hand picking someone because they're younger and more technologically savy would be descriminatory. We will follow with the process of evaluating people in the manner that HR advises. Whoever is selected, we will give the transferred employees the full training that is standard in order for them to be proficient at our plant. Again, i appreciate your input and your concern. thanks, Jamie",NA,"Alex, I am sorry to hear that this happened in my area. I will address it with my team lead. Jamie",NA,NA,"Jennifer, I appreciate you bringing this to my attention. One of the first items i have addressed on my first day was talking with my team leads about issues concerning morale in our team and how we can improve it. It is fair to draw some connections between morale and absenteeism, and I have contacted Karen to discuss absenteeism policies, trends, etc. that I am not familiar with so that i can put together a strategy going forward. As for the instances with excessive repairs, I will have to look into this further. Excessive repairs does not necessarily equate to underperforming team members. I will examine the circumstances surrounding these repairs. If they were found not to be because of operator error and were deemed necessary, i must stand behind this because i don't want sacrificesafety or quality for production levels. Thanks again for your feedback and insight. Jamie",NA,"JJ, I want to first commend your work on this. I can tell your passionate about making a change that will help your team. I would ask, though, that you hold off on moving forward with the order until we can discuss it further. In the spirit of the the core principles of the SmartChanges process, i think we need to first make sure that Carson Spilkes is brought into the discussion. There may be something that Carson can add from an engineering perspective that will help us avoid issues with this change (e.g., perhaps it may not be feasible to operate the specific turntable we are ordering in our specific environment). Also, since i am new to this specific study, i would like time to look at what we are proposing. I know that Paul had previously been involved, but i wouldn't feel comfortable signing off on a change in trim installation until i am more educated it. I understand that this may delay the the test implementation of your solution, but i think it will give us the best chance of success. Lastly, while I appreciate your dedication and commitment to this SmartChanges team (going above and beyond by working on it with your own time in your evening class), i would caution you about disclosing information about our company's production/processes with people on the outside.It is probably best todiscusswith human resources what is acceptable to disclose and what is not, because sometimes issues of intellectual property and trade secrets are of concern. I am looking forward to getting a meeting together when I return from vacation so that Ican hear about your idea in more detail and also get some feedback from Carson as to the engineering implications, and hopefully implementing the turntable so we can become more efficient in our trim installation. Thank you, Jamie From: Paxton, J.J. Sent: 4/5/2016 9:24 AM To: Pace, Jamie Cc: Subject : Turntable Proposal Hi Jamie,  We are pretty close to the end of the SmartChanges process and were confident that we have found a way to speed up trim installation. The main change is to attach the frame of a NoiseBreaker to a kind of turntable which would rotate around as the team members installed the various pieces of trim. We think that it will save the team members a lot of walking around during the installation process. We hoped to include Carson Spilkes, but he was too busy. So, the main people working on it were me, Paul Bern, and Emily Carson. We produced a draft design that should be simple to manufacture.  I led the research by pulling a lot of data and working on it at home to make sure that our calculations were correct. I take a statistics class in the evenings and I thought that my classmates might also be able to add some insight. My professor and fellow students helped me to look more closely at some recent SEQUENCE data and how our current process has affected efficiency. We all concluded there was room for improvement.  Anyway, I know that Paul found a supplier that can manufacture the turntable and he also found some money in the budget to get the unit built and installed. Pauls research indicates that the turntable will take two months to build and ship, and another week to install.  I know youre busy today, so Ill plan on calling Barrett Remini today to place our order with the supplier. If you want any details, set up an appointment with me for when you return and we can go over it.  Thanks!  -J.J. J.J. Paxton Lead, Trim Install","Isaac, I am eager to be a part of this and look forward to the opportunity for my team to be the test for a new technology such as this. I am curious how theinstallation of the software will affect production since it will take all day on April 15th. I am especially interested in this since i will be out on vacation during this time and return on the 20th. Is there anyway that the software install can take place during the weekend? Also, would it be possible to move the test period forward to the 20th so i can be present? If this is not an option I will have one of my team leads, Robin Moskowitz report the feedback to you in my absence for the first two days of the trial. Thanks and i look forward to hearing from you. Jamie",NA,"Cory, While i think the motivation of this lunch was a great idea, i don't think it is good for overall morale to declare someone ""the victor"". Especially in this case where the metric could be open to interpretation. I would rather meet with each team lead individually and give them feedback on their strengths or weaknesses. I just want to avoid demoralizing anyone publicly. What are your thoughts? Jamie",NA,"Vic, I appreciate you bringing this to my attention. I would ask that you wait until we go through the proper channels and get all of the information. I would suggest that JJ and myself meet first so i can get more information as his supervisor. Then perhaps Karen and I can discuss it. Karen, Can you advise on the proper action?","Original Message----- From: Assessment Administrator Sent: 4/5/2016 2:20 PM To: Pace, Jamie Cc: Subject : About your day (1 of 2) i handled each challenge in the order i received it.

TWuvWZcpeYI,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Shea - Please schedule Al for 12:00 - 1:00 pm and bring in lunch for the team. Let's do it in conference room BP07. Thanks! Jamie,NA,NA,"J.J - Excellent Work! This sounds lke a great idea that should be taken through the Smart Changes process. Since Emily has been part of your team, I'm sure she will guide you through the process. This very innovative and worth further evaluation before it's put into full production. Let's make sure we follow the Smartchanges process before any implementation or purchasing is done. On a side note, I am asking for you to ask permission before data is shared with other folks outside of Soundproof solutions. As you know, we have a very tight operations and sensitive data that is confidential. There was a hiccup in a security stroll last week, but I believe that to be resolved. In future, please ask me first before you share data. They (your professors) should sign confidentiality agreements and we need to work through that approval process. Jamie Karen - Per my earlier email regarding the allegation of theft, please see the good ideas that J.J. Paxton and team have arrived at for some process improvements. As information has become available - I do not recommend that Vic go forward with his approach to discuss with JJ about the confidential company information. I will discuss with J.J. the need to get permissions prior to any further reseach projects of this nature. Thanks Jamie Vic, Emily Carson was working with JJ Praxton on a Sequence improvement idea with the data. In future, please address all suspicions with me prior to alleging theft. Jamie","Isaac - Thanks for reaching out. Is it possible to delay implementation of the software until I return from vacation? I would like to be here when this critical change occurs.  Please adjust schedule for 1 week delay, starting software conversion on 4/22 instead of 4/15. If this is a problem, let me know. Thanks Jamie",NA,"Cory, Attached is the questionnaire from the Cross-Training Excercise between Pat & J.J Paxton last week. The victory lunch is on the 7th. Thanks for handling the winner announcement. Based upon average score, it appears that Pat Landis received the highest marks. But, based uponsome ofour focus SEQUENCYqualities (employee engagement and considering problems carefully), it appears that J.J. Paxton had some good scores as well. Since there is only one winner, you should congratulate Pat as the overall winner, but please commend J.J. for doing well in these 2 categories of performance. Thanks Jamie",NA,"Vic - Can you please call me about this matter today? I need to understand the whole background. Jamie  Vic & Karen - If this was indeed theft, then I support escorting J.J. Praxton out the door. J.J. is a team leader in my group andthere could be a legitimate business need for him to be viewing confidential operationsinformation. Vic - I would support sitting down and discussing this matter with J.J. this afternoon. Sincethis issuewasn'taddressed the day it was observed,then I believe we need to ensure we have all of the factsin handbefore he is terminated. Karen -Since today is my first day, I need to knowASAP if downloading company confidential information is against Company Policy. Since this an urgent matter, I  Vic, I left you a voice mail earlier today on this matter. Given our focus employee engagement and these Smart Changes that we are asking everyone to do (be innovative, provide solutions), there could be a legitimate reason for J.J. to have downloaded information if he was performing research to solve a line problem. Let's discuss this issue with J.J. this afternoon and try to get to the bottom of why he had the information first. If it's against company policy for him to do work at home, then I am completly supportive of your recommendation My concern is that action wasn't taken on the day of the issue, but is now a week later. Jamie  Karen It has come to my attention that confidential business information was downloaded last week. Vic Daisher will be getting with HR regarding termination papers of J.J. Paxton. Before we terminate J.J, I need to understand if it is Company Policy that no confidential information get downloaded from internet servers. J.J. may have had a legitimate business reason to perform research since he is a team leader and responsible for implementing SEQUENCE within his job line. If it is company policy, then I support the termination and will talk to J.J. with Vic. Since this is my first day of work, I would like your presepctive regarding ourexpectations of these teamleaders, and whether they have ability to work at home on work-related items.

Please list the major categories of issues or problems facing Final Assembly in the Bridgeport facility of Soundproof Solutions. Mistrust of new initiative by employees Desire for engagement but not really asking for front-line experiences Lots of ideas - job rotation, suggestion box, smartchanges - occurring all at once without a systemic plan or time to allow the workforce to assimilate the changes.  3. Describe why each entry in Question 2 is an issue or problem. In general, there is mistrust about whether the company really has the employees best interests at heart. There is a feeling that the SEQUENCE process is being implemented in a vacuum with little employee engagement, when employee engagement is at the heart of the SEQUENCE initiative. The employees are brimming with ideas, but haven't yet had someone to champion their voices to upper management. Teamwork and clarity of vision needs better communicated.  Change is good. Change for the right reasons are good, but there appears to be a force of Change for the sake of changing that is being implemented too quickly. There appears to be some hiccups on sequence implementation that are occurring way to quickly without a systematic plan or the benefits of each being fully thought out. Upper Management is walking the walk, but not abiding by the smartchanges process along the way.

I'm glad that you care enough about your team to let me know of something you see as a problem.Please know that I'm reviewing all the quality reports from your team, and will be dealing with the problems in the very near future.  I've noticed a lot of absences and a corresponding increase in repairs. I, like you, want to be sure everyone is doing their part to produce the highest level of quality.I commit to you that I'll be in touch with you when I return to discuss the rework rates.In the meantime, I trust you'll do your level best to be sure your work is the best it can be. In so doing, you'll be the example that all the other team members see!!Thanks again for your interest in and support of the team.Regards,Jamie",NA,NA,"Hi Alex:Just wanting to follow up with you on your note below.I wasn't able to get with the folks you mentioned in your note, but have begun addressing them.

What a great idea.Is there any chance you can postpone this activity until the following week? I will have just been back one day from two weeks away, and would really like to get a bit settled in before this talk. It would give me some time to work with you, Al, on some activities to engage our team in the experience. If that's not possible, I'd like to schedule the session from 2 - 3 PM in room BP07. I hope we won't use the projector for Power Point slides, and I'd like a flip chart for each table to let the groups brainstorm and then share their thoughts with the whole group.Since it's late in the afternoon, can we aim for a snack tray of meat and cheese? Protein helps the brain, especially as the day wears on.Thanks again for setting this up, Shea. And thank you, Al, for including FA - L1 in this process.",NA,NA,"Hi JJ:A quick note to follow up on the voice mail I left you today.I want to be clear about my request that you NOT contact Barrett Remini today. There is no reason to rush, and I want to be a lot more informed about the purchasebefore any action is taken. Let's try again to get Carson Spilkes involved. While I'm gone please schedule a meeting for the week of April 25th to include Carson, Emily, you and me. We'll review all the available data at that time and make an informed decision.Until then, please do not take any action to purchase the turntable or incur any other capital expense.Thanks for your initiative. I look forward to making a joint, data-based, informedresponsible decisions?Regards,Jamie","Hi Isaac:I look forward to meeting you, too! I have the highest regard for anyone in IT. Isaac, I'm a little concerned with the projected time line outlined below. I've copied Cory Manning and Al Howard so we can all look this over and be sure it's the right thing to do at the right time.Since there is some flexibility with this install, I wonder if we might wait until after the audit which is happening on April 18th. I appreciate that the auditors try not to interrupt operations, but if there are any glitches with the install, and/or staff have trouble with using it, (since they won't get training until after the install is complete), issues may arise.I wonder if we're not risking some problems that we don't need to have during the audit. What if an auditor wants an employee to pull records from the system, and they can't? What if, during the trial period, the new software doesn't effectively talk to our other systems and robotic production is negativelyimpacted?I wouldn't ask, except that you mentioned the ability to be flexible. Is there a compelling reason to install the new software, or can we postpone the installation until after April 18th?Thanks for your consideration.Regards, Jamie",NA,NA,NA,Hi Vic:Thanks for your note. Can you stop by quickly so we can chat about this before you terminate J.J.? I'd like to review the information with you to be sure we don't have a grievance filed that we can't win.The fact that you went into his backpack during lunch without his knowledge will very likely be a bone of contention: and deservedly so. I would hope we would utilize a more straightforward approach to dealing with these kinds of concerns. I would expect thecompany to have a process whereby searches are acceptable as long as the employee knows about them.I want to understand the guidelines better before I support this action. Please stop by before you do anything else. Thanks very much.Jamie,"Dear Assessment Administrator:1.) I handled each challenge based on what I perceived as their importance. I opened them from the bottom up and responded based on the contents. For instance, when I read that Vic was going to walk JJ out, I phoned him and emailed him suggesting we talk about it first, as it could have led to a grievance [what with Vic going into JJ's backpack :( ]Likewise, I felt JJ's behaviors were really detrimental to the whole team, so I jotted a note to him saying firstly that I wished we could be having a conversation, but noting that there were some issues I needed to address before I left.I truly DO believe that the greatest resources in any business are their human resources, so I strive to strengthen and support the people who make the business work. I do feel like I can stay focused on the business at hand, but want to honor the people who do it, too!2.) My interpretation of thedata presented suggest to me that Mr. Bern left a damaged work group in his wake.2a.) I think the people need to be validated (and culled....can you say JJ?) before there will be significant change.2b.) There is not enough enterprise wide collaboration.2c.)I didn't see a lotof attention being paid to external forces3a.) I think Pat Landis' idea to get rid of the consultants is a great one as long as there's a plan in place to use the internal staff to pick up the slack.3b.) Like so many companies (which will remain nameless) silos are preventing significant standardized growth.3c.) I believe Soundproof Solutions ought be courting Sugoi International to explore consolidating businesses to maximize growth and innovation in design, reduce manufacturing costs and increase sales growth. If none of those reasons are worth working with Sugoi, let's go shadow their best practices for employee satisfaction!Original Message-----From: Assessment Administrator Sent: 4/5/2016 2:20 PM To: Pace, Jamie Cc: Subject : About your day (1 of 2) This e-mail and the one that follows contain some final questions for you.

Respect for each other is a critical element when running a business. 2. There is some resistance to the implementation of SEQUENCE. Some work groups are not working well with other groups. Morale on the Driver Mount line is very low. 3. When everyone is not following the same standard, it causes confusion and quality and productivity suffer. When groups don't work together to achieve common goals small issues usually become bigger than they should be affecting everyone's productivity. When morale is low people aren't focused on their job. They don't have a vested interest in whether the company is successful. Work suffers and attendance issues usually increase.Original Message----- From: Assessment Administrator Sent: 4/5/2016 8:15 PM To: Pace, Jamie Cc: Subject : About your day (1 of 2)  This e-mail and the one that follows contain some final questions for you.

Can you build a temporary version of the turntable before you send out drawings? Even a primitive mock up will help identify issues before sending out the drawings to have the turntable made. Taking a few days to get this done will save time in the long run. let me know today if there is a problem getting this done.Thanks.","Morning Isaac, I am looking forward to working with you and taking advantage of this new software.I've already heard some complaints about positioning problems with the old software. However, I think the timeline needs some adjustment.I will be on vacation April 5-20, and I need to be here to supervise the installation. Also, I do not think we should risk a whole week of production time with new software that has not been run in a real production environment before.I can get some of my key team members to work the weekend of April 23 and 24. We can try the new software then and with two full days of testing with no production, we should be able to get most of the bugs worked out. Then we can re-install the old software for the production week. That puts you back to making revisions on the week of April 25-29. Can you give me a contact for that week that we can work with to create some procedures? That way we can be ready for training on May 2. I'll call and we can work out the details, and make sure this fits in the Smartchange framework. Thanks again.",NA,"Thanks paul, hope things are going well in the jungle.I'll ask Cory to buy lunch for both guys, while making it clear who won. I want to do all I can to reinforce the team spirit.",NA,"Vic please see the attached e-mail from JJ. I am sure the transfer of information was not malicious, though obviously way against company policy and good sense. Pending Cory's approval, I suggest we enter a formal write up in JJ's file and give him a chance to explain himself. I understand the importance of company data, but I am sure the intent was not malicious. I think this e-mail will clarify things, though we will need to understand exactly what info was communicated to who before we close this.Hi Jamie,  We are pretty close to the end of the SmartChanges process and were confident that we have found a way to speed up trim installation. The main change is to attach the frame of a NoiseBreaker to a kind of turntable which would rotate around as the team members installed the various pieces of trim. We think that it will save the team members a lot of walking around during the installation process. We hoped to include Carson Spilkes, but he was too busy. So, the main people working on it were me, Paul Bern, and Emily Carson. We produced a draft design that should be simple to manufacture.  I led the research by pulling a lot of data and working on it at home to make sure that our calculations were correct. I take a statistics class in the evenings and I thought that my classmates might also be able to add some insight. My professor and fellow students helped me to look more closely at some recent SEQUENCE data and how our current process has affected efficiency. We all concluded there was room for improvement.  Anyway, I know that Paul found a supplier that can manufacture the turntable and he also found some money in the budget to get the unit built and installed. Pauls research indicates that the turntable will take two months to build and ship, and another week to install.  I know youre busy today, so Ill plan on calling Barrett Remini today to place our order with the supplier. If you want any details, set up an appointment with me for when you return and we can go over it. Thanks!  -J.J.J.J. PaxtonLead, Trim Install","1.

GjXYepXXBqx,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Larry,Today I witnessed aninteraction between you and Emily Carson. I expect you to show all members of the staff here at sound systems respect.Emily has a job to do and that job is toimpliment the sequence program. In your time here I am sure you have seen many ""ideas"" come and go. However, the Sequence model while it is a buz word is agood model ofhow we should do business. think about each section of the sequence program are any of the sections something that you disagree with? If they are please let me know.Now that you understand it is the ideals of sequience that you are being asked to support not the buz word I trust I have your cooperation to hold true to the ideals of seqence and focus on implimenting the ideals and supporting the ideals with your coworkers.Just because someone is new or a different background asEmily does not mean they are not avalued and necessary member of our team.A differentbackground should not be used as an excuse tothrowup road blocks to the project someone else is encouraging.I will speak to Emily as well aboutwhat she said to you. Emily,I witnessed your conversation with Larry Hodges concerning the Sequence Program. When presenting a new program it is common for experianced employees to decide the program is the flavor of the month. You should anticipate such reactions and be ready for them. One way to get the point across is to challenge the employee on the specific goals of the program. You will be hard pressed to find an employee who is not in favor of a safe workplace or who thinks saftey is a new goal. Have them connect the ""new"" empasis programs with past empasis programs and understand the goal has not changed. Do not let your temper get the better of you. If you snap back at the employee you have lost control of the situation. If necessary to maintain your composure you may end the conversation and leave the area.No matter what was said by Larry bringing up his personell reccord was inappropriate and you should not be aware of the information in other employee's personell records.I have also spoken with Larry about his behaviour.Jamie.",NA,JJHave you discussed these concerns with Debby? Moving Debby to another team does not solve the issue. It just moves the issue to another area where it may not be handeled as effectivly. Sit down with Debby and disucss your concerns over her performance including tardiness and rework. Ask her to commit to an improvement. plan. Together you and she need to draft the improvment plan. provide me with notes over the next month on when she has met the plan and when she has not.,"Cory,is there any truth to the rumorbelow that JJ mentions? If so I would like to see an opportunity for the team leads and myself to have a quick introduction to the new employees and have an opportunity to see who will be a good fit for each team.",NA,"Gentlemen,Please read the note i recieved below reguarding a recent plant tour. The expectation is that we behave in a professional manner all the time while at work. Not only does this show respect to your coworkers it also shows coustomers which may tour our plant at anytime that we have professional employees that care about their quality of work.SEQUENCE is a company princible that we at Sound solutions strive to embody. The princibles are sound if you disagree please let me know other wise I will expect you to follow them.Harrasment of any kind will not be tolerated. including making comments about coustomers if you have any questions concerning company policy let me know.",NA,"Shea,Schedule the meeting during lunch and schedule it in BP07. Please send a notice to everyone concerning the upcomming meeting and let them know lunch will be provided. Thanks","Jennifer,I have spoken with JJ about this as the issues are coming from his line. Please provide next month's numbers as soon as you get them so I can see what progress we are making. Also, please take a look at the repair numbers in reguards to JJ being on the line I believe you will see more of a corelation that then Karen's absences. Cory,Attached are the March Repair Report and Absentee report which I mentioned inmy email reguarding the quality investigation. JJ.Take a look at the attached repair volumes for March. I am noticing a trend on the repair volumes increase when you are filling in. Please giveme your perspective on how that can be fixed. I lookforward to seeingan improvemtn inMay's numbers.Jamie",NA,JJDo not order the turn table at this time. I am comming into this fresh and need some details before I will approve this expense.Please give me a breakdown of the cost of the project and the draft design.  Plan to take me though where it will be used and how it will help when I get back on the 22nd.Once I have that information we can disucss placing the order when I get back and have had time to review the proposal. I am very pleased with the initiative you have taken to come up with this idea and look forward to learning more about it.,"Isaac,Please plan on providing initial training to the team befor the software is installed April 15.The week of April 18th we will need onsite support to awnser any questions. I will not be in the office during this time so team leads please use Cory as the main channel for concerns and copy each other, Cory and myself on all concerns.During the week of April 25-29 or earlier you must uninstall the software and revert us back to the old software while you make the changes if it is not useable in its current state. If it is leaving it installed and us on the software while you fix the bugs is acceptable. Communicate any changes to the software with the team leaders and their teams prior to the May 2nd bug fix. I would expect the training requred for May 2nd-6th is continued support by your team for questions as we use the software not full training after it has been implimented.If full training is needed you must complete beforethe May2nd install or delay the install.Jamie.",NA,Pat and JJI just recieved the results from your cross training leadership surveys. You both did exceptionally well. This is the sort of performance I would like to encourage in all the team leaders. I know both of you are most interested in who did better. Pat had the highest score and gets lunch. However I cannot express how well you both did. I would like to do this same thing again in a month and see if the scores change and once again Lunch for the winner.Pat...you need to focus on yourtechnical knowledge to improvewhich JJ I expect you to help with that. JJ you need to focus on decision making and treating group members equally.Your scores are attached so you can see how you did on each metric.Attachment,NA,"Vic,Was the information on the disk concerning the assembly of the sound system. JJ has been working ondeveloping a project to install a turntable inassembly and then estimate thesavingsto justify this turn tablein a statistics class he has been taking. Do not fire JJ.

Please list the major categories of issues or problems facing Final Assembly in the Bridgeport facility of Soundproof Solutions.A Poor communication and fighting between teamsB Poor communication of objectivesC Lack of professional conduct3. Describe why each entry in Question 2 is an issue or problem.A - the fighting between teams and factioned nature of the plant enviroment lead to multiple examples of loss of production and efficiancy including slowing down the line with Quinn, failure to fully leverage the abilities of all employees as seen with Robin, this in the long run will also lead to worker turn over, it is also leading to difficulties getting everyone to listen to new ideas including the sequence program because they are completly focused their individual success.B- the teams clearly do not understand sequence and as a result have not bought into the sequence program dispite an upcomming audit concerning the program.This is also leading to division between managment and the floor and leading to customers questioning the company when it is being used as a sales technique and on the floor it is rejected.C-Inappropriate comments are a excellent invitation for a lawsuit aimed at Costomers no less. Employees nearly getting in fist fights, somehow the Quality Process employee seems to know about the content of HR files, and the lack of understanding of trade secrets. This place is open to lawsuits and going to make their great ideas their competitor's ideas.Original Message-----From: Assessment Administrator Sent: 4/5/2016 1:10 PM To: Pace, Jamie Cc: Subject : About your day (2 of 2) Following are some of the e-mails that you received today, along with some questions about how you approached them.

Did you handle each challenge in the order you received it, or did you handle them another way? Please describe your approach.I handled them based on a perception of priority. I also estimated how much time I had today prior to vacation and if the issue could be handled by my replacement or wait until I returned. I wrote each issue down in my planner and prioritized them by importance. Each time I recieved a new initiative I reprioritized the list along with the remaining unresolved issues. I utilized voice mail, email, meetings and sometimes all three to resolve issues.2. Please list the major categories of issues or problems facing Final Assembly in the Bridgeport facility of Soundproof Solutions.Understanding of sequence by all leads and line workers is a huge issue. Personnel conflicts is the second issue.Lastly, Production issues with line and equipment and future changes were noted.3. Describe why each entry in Question 2 is an issue or problem.SEQUENCE is the core business model the company has adopted as their flagship forimprovment moving forward. It is supported by upper management but due to poor role out, engagement, and leadership at the supevisory level it has some issues that need resolved. The process is not clearly understood and embraced by all of the line leads this needs resolved first.Next the line workers do not clearly understand or trust SEQUENCE this needs to be resolved second.Resolution to the issues withSEQUENCE in the supervisory level is training, building trust and engagement. With the line workers they need training, engagement, and ecouragement that their ideas are valuable and trusted. Building committents with supervision and line workers with stabalize and strengthen SEQUENCE and esure its success.There are some definite personnel issues that need resolved. JJ's potential theft of company meterials needs to be vetted apporpriately and resolved. this could be just a misunderstanding but losing him and creating a worst situation by handling it inapporpraitely could damage the companies reputation in the community as well as cause the employees to lose confidence in the leadership. This is a huge issue that requires discreet handling, Debbies absenteeism along with Larry's behavior creates a mistrusting environment. Debbie cannot be relied upon to show up causing JJ to have to fill in a concern. Overworking JJ as a fill in appears to have had negative affects on him as well. Larry is creating peripheral discussions that are damaging and negative to the SEQUENCE and its future success. Larry needs to be coached along with Debbie. JJ's issue needs to be resolved by Human resources not just the security guy alone.Production line issues with fabric failures or misalgnmnets are quality issues. Engaging the team and performing an investigation should produce some positive reults in completed appropriately. SEQUENCE was developed to handle those issues but needs firmed up first then these issues should have a mechanism to resolve themselves moving forward.Original Message-----From: Assessment Administrator Sent: 4/5/2016 1:21 PM To: Pace, Jamie Cc: Subject : About your day (2 of 2) Following are some of the e-mails that you received today, along with some questions about how you approached them.

YXOrYNxqtvr,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"I did speak with Larry Hodges about this matter and reminded him that policies and procedures do change and we don' t run our facility the same way we did 20 years ago. I also talked to him about being a professional and respectful for all people in the facility. I will monitor the situation and if another one comes up, I will notify HR and follow the proper process on taking further action.Thank You, Jamie",NA,"J.J.,I will speak with Debby about not bringing her personal problems to work as it hurts all of our production. I will also instruct her to go to HR and speak with them about maybe getting some help with counseling or anything else that may get her through her personal problems. We are a team here and we need to stick together and make sure we all our doing our jobs to our fullest potential. I will keep you posted on anything that I find out and please let me know if the work continues to be not up to standards.Thank You,Jamie","J.J.,I have been hearing that we may get some of the employees also but lets not be a rush to judgement on what those personnel can and cannot do. What they maybe lacking in updated equipment skills they will be bringing in many years of experience that we all can absorb and aquire. It is not fare to rush to judgement so we are going to split them up and fill the needs of the team equally and I am sure that everyone will help train and guide them into becoming strong team members. We need to make sure that our training and instruction is clear and everyone understands what is expected of everyone on the team. Together, we will be a better working group with all of us understanding and fully following the SEQUENCE process.Thank You,Jamie",NA,"Alex,Thank you for bringing this concern to my attention. Professionalism is expected at all time and anyone that does not adhere to those policies and procedures will be counseled on such matters. I willaddress any and all matters with the appropriate individuals in a timely matter and will direct any and all information to the proper department if more action is required.Thank You,Jamie",NA,"Shea,I will make sure that everyone on the team is fully understanding of the importance of the SEQUENCE roll out and that after the full implementation, it will make work more efficient for all of us. I will be back from my vacation on the 20th and the time and location of the meeting seems to be just fine. Again, I will make sure all members of the team are onboard with this and look forward to the meetingsThank You,Jamie","Jennifer, I will make sure to look back at all the data and try to find a start point of when the repairsstarted to pick up. I will speak with all the team members and instruct them on how important it is to make sure that they keep their mind on task and will also look at the absent records for each of the team members. If I find that their are some that are absent on a frequent basis, I will speak with them individually and make sure HR is informed of any and all of the information that I gather. I will also look at the training records and make sure all individuals have received all the training necessary for the SEQUENCE roll out and provide extra training(if necessary) for those individuals that may be lacking in such training.Thank You,Jamie",NA,"J.J.,Anything that would help the team members to do their job more effectively and possible cut cost is something that I totally support.As you know I will be away until the 20th of this month but I would like to schedule an appointment with you and Emily to discuss the implementation and training that the associates would have to do with the new turntable being put into place. As always, safety is the key and I want to make sure all team members are trained and ready for this new piece of equipment. If possible, lets try to meet on the 21st and discuss the details.

I will be back on the 20th of April and will look at any and all data that the roll out and staff came up with and will get with you on the feed back that was noted. I am looking forward to the new software and I am sure our team will be ready for the changes.Thank You,Jamie",NA,"Paul,As you know I will not be able to attend the luch due to not being in the facility on that date. I will try to speak with both individuals before I leave but will not announce any scores to anyone since this was a ""made up "" survey for entertainment purposes only.

They know the proper procedures that one must do before such actions take place. I CC'd Karen Duvalier to this email so she will have a heads up to your attentions.

rpUkaJgngzu,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,No she will be staying on your team for the foreseeable future.Ifshe is having attendance issues those will be addressed.Jamie,"J.J.No, we will probably not be able to pick what teams absorb workers from Kirkland. I understand your concern, however we need to welcome them to the process we have here. It may be burdensome at first but there will be a pain period to get them trained on the newer equipment and get them up to speed. Keep in mind that their experiences with antiquated equipment may mean we will be bringing in people that are skilled and experience troubleshooters. We may have it good now with the new equipment, but there is a skill they will bring that we may desperately need, especially when rolling out a new product.Jamie",NA,"Norman,I will get with my leads and address these issues. I'll make certain that they holda face-to facewith their perspective teams and discuss our expectations on what is considered to be appropriate conversation and behavior in the workplace. I'm truly sorry that this happened and it had to be even more embarrassing for Velma. As for the trash observed on the floor and around work areas that will be taken care of immediately. All employees should know our housekeeping expectations, and if they don't, they will by the end of the day.Jamie",NA,"April 21st is fine. It looks like the 12-1 pm slot will work in room BP07.Thanks,Jamie","Jennifer,I have Lee and J.J. investigating the events surrounding March. I recently received an email from Cory Manning about 12 Model 1 units from Doxy that will have to be repaired under warranty work. Any failure after such a recent delivery date is unacceptable. I'm hoping to here back from Lee and J.J. before the day is out to find the root cause and a get a resolution before I leave for vacation.Jamie",NA,"J.J. I think it's a great idea but I don't think you should be sharing company information with anyone outside the company. If you want to research a better process on your own free time, you are welcome to do so. However, taking that information off-site may give some the wrong impression.Jamie","Isaac,The dates are fine, however I would like the team trained before the software is officially rolled out, not after the fact.Thanks,Jamie",NA,I'm in agreement. Let's give him his lunch on the 7th.,NA,"Vic,I willtake care of it. Do not escort J.J. out of the plant, I think I know what this is about.Jamie","1. No I didn't handle them in the order I received them. Some required a little more though and reflection to deal with before proceeding, particularly some of social conflicts amongst employees.2. A. Lack of trust.B. Hoarding of informationC. Poor communication3. There is a general consensus at SS that if you want anything done right, you must do it yourself. The trust isn't there, if you just have supervisors take over and do everything and hoard information ultimately your feeding this notion of lack of self worth around the people you're supervising. It kills engagement and communication. It feeds indignation and contempt. What you end up with is every employee either becoming hyper competitive and not part of the team, or waiting for someone to do their job for them.-----Original Message-----From: Assessment Administrator Sent: 4/5/2016 2:20 PM To: Pace, Jamie Cc: Subject : About your day (1 of 2) This e-mail and the one that follows contain some final questions for you.

It could be that there were some extenuating circumstances around these calls that took longer. Think about what additional data could be added in this study to give more perspective about what is going on during the call. Also 10 calls is a very low sample, you might think about increasing the data pool and see if you get the same results.Since I will be out for the next two weeks that should give some time to pull additional data to incorporate into this study. I will be interested in your findings upon my return.Cary,",NA,NA,"Taylor,From Jerry's scores it appears he could still use some coaching in some of the areas and tends to act more on his own agenda rather for the team. As a coordinator it is imporatant to work for the group not the individual. Please set aside some time to work on these areas before temporarly appointing him coordinator.

There are other concerns that need to be addressed so I will be sending out an email to the entire team.Cary,",NA,"Taylor,Before accusing of Weedler of cheating I feel it would be appropriate to point out the next time he calls in for a replacement that his replacement calls are higher than average or another suggestion is to ask Weedler since he seems to be having so many issues with rolls of paper that we would like for him to begin sending in the defective rolls backso we can appropriately address theissues with the production team.Either of these approaches would make Weedler aware that we are noticing his high replacement calls. If he continues to request then we can escalation the issue.Cary,","Liang,Tracy has informed me of his information gathering. I believe we need to have HR review this before a decision is made on termination.Cary, Marge,Could you please review this matter and let me know how to proceed? Tracy did let me know that he did analyze some data for his statistics class. I support learning endeavors and would hate to see him terminated over this incident. I have told him that he does need to get approval in the future for any such information gathering. I will also forward an additonal email from Tracy on the matter.Cary","1. There doesn't seem to be enough resources to handle the workload. This is problem because customers will be unhappy with having delayed installation times. There also seems to be a communication problem which leads to various issues with unhappy employees and ultimately unhappy customers. There is also a lack of communication between internal departments so which presents a disorganized company.2. Issue with quietPAPER ONE because this will be a hugh customer service issue and we need to make sure each customer complaint is address quickly and effectively or this could spiral and create a very bad reputation for the company. The emails relating to respect (Eluto and Professional) conduct are also of importance in that is shows the team is divided and unaware of how their actions affect others. It is important to have team unity and pride in the job that you do in order for the organization to be a success. Third I would say the email about Fletcher systems, going back to customer service, if a major account is unhappy this needs to be addressed quickly so as not to have a major financial impact on the compant.3. Tracy's email and Liang's email were related and I wish I would have not responded to Tracy before I received Liang's. Other related emails included Cheryl's email about my calendar in relation to the Paperless Office email and installation in sales email. I had to consider the scheduling all three. There were several emails relating to the Installation calendar email which in turn required follow up emails to Taylor on schedule. Also the professional conduct email had me considering my response to the email about Eluto.4. I would have like information from the team leads on employeesin order to adequately list who would be ready for promotion and level 2. It would have helped to know the size of each account in order prioritize installations."

Why? quietPAPER ONE: A new product is faulty and will start to produce complaints in two weeks I felt that this needed to be handled quickly due to the amount of call we are looking to receive. Professional conduct: A salesperson complains that representatives behave unprofessionally This will impact future sales if this wasnt addressed Weedler Contracting: A customer is suspected of abusing the companys replacement policies This was important due to the customer had a running history of this behavior and was placing another order soon and needed to know we were watching him. 3.

For example, when you decided how respond to one message, did you consider information provided not only in that message, but in other message(s)? One decision I was unable to make without the use of another email was the rational of the level 2 promotion.

I would like to move out the installation of software to the 16th of April potentially alleviating any loss of productivity on Friday the 15th. Hi Jamie,I look forward to meeting you in person. I will be your contact in the Information Technology department. Anything to do with the programming of production machinery is handled exclusively by my team. Please let me know of any programming needs you have and I will do my best to satisfy them. I have been talking with Al Howard about our new robot programming software. It should help make adjusting the robots and switching between programs much faster than before. Further, your team members will be able to make some adjustments to the robots directly, without involving Engineering or Maintenance. This will save both time and money, and has been approved by both Engineering and Maintenance. It is definitely very different from the current software in place. Al agreed that your group will be the test site for the entire company as we try to get the software finalized. Here is the rollout plan I propose. Please note these dates.Friday April 15: Install the software. We will need a full day to install and configure the software. The installation is automated, and will be done over the networkno one will need to go to your plant. However, we will need to take the current system down while we do this. We will remove your existing software at this time as well, since we are replacing it.April 18-22: Your staff will use the software and report any issues to you. You will send the reports to me and I will act on them. April 25-29: We will make changes to the software to correct problems found by your team.May 2: We will officially roll out the new software for your team to use.Week of May 2-6: We will train your team on using the software now that it is complete. I talked this over with your team leaders and they had no concerns, but they asked that I take it up with you to confirm that we may go forward with this plan. Note that we are very flexible, so please get back to me by the end of the day with any changes you propose to make to this plan or schedule.

I think that your team is losing focus. I reviewed Line 1s Trim Install repairs for March and found that your team had several days with excessive repairs. Im sure youre aware how time-consuming repairs can negatively impact our SEQUENCE results.I am attaching some information that you might find helpful. I have combined my teams summary of Marchs Trim Install Repairs for Group A along with an Absence Report that Karen Duvalier provided. Its not unusual for one or two people to be sick or absent on any given day. We find substitutions and carry on with production; however, its clear to me that when Larry isnt on the line, errors go up. Overall, your team really struggled with repairs in March. I suppose Paul was more interested in preparing for his new assignment than he was about overseeing the teams activities. Please review the attached information. If there is any way for me to assist in reducing repair rates for April, please let me know. Thanks,JenniferJennifer LakeManager, Quality ProcessesAttachment",NA,"J.J., since the Smart Changes process has it's own checks and balances, and provides the path for total confirmation of the value added, I believe you must present to Spikes to maintain that flow.

Get with Spikes as soon as he is available, push if necessary.From: Paxton, J.J. Sent: 4/5/2016 9:24 AM To: Pace, Jamie Cc: Subject : Turntable Proposal Hi Jamie,We are pretty close to the end of the SmartChanges process and were confident that we have found a way to speed up trim installation. The main change is to attach the frame of a NoiseBreaker to a kind of turntable which would rotate around as the team members installed the various pieces of trim. We think that it will save the team members a lot of walking around during the installation process. We hoped to include Carson Spilkes, but he was too busy. So, the main people working on it were me, Paul Bern, and Emily Carson. We produced a draft design that should be simple to manufacture.I led the research by pulling a lot of data and working on it at home to make sure that our calculations were correct. I take a statistics class in the evenings and I thought that my classmates might also be able to add some insight. My professor and fellow students helped me to look more closely at some recent SEQUENCE data and how our current process has affected efficiency. We all concluded there was room for improvement. Anyway, I know that Paul found a supplier that can manufacture the turntable and he also found some money in the budget to get the unit built and installed. Pauls research indicates that the turntable will take two months to build and ship, and another week to install.I know youre busy today, so Ill plan on calling Barrett Remini today to place our order with the supplier. If you want any details, set up an appointment with me for when you return and we can go over it.Thanks!-J.J.J.J.

Example, Availability of additional level 1 resources, I forwarded on to my coordinator to only get an email later about quietpaper one call coming in the same week, had to send the email requesting the additional staff.Example 2, Promotions, needed to look at several emails to get all the details. Example 3, the helpful employee with call stats that say quicker call times = happier customers to only find out later that he might have made it up to steal data, still need to investigate that,Example 4, Scheduling installations4) better way to organize attachments and files, some items launched in adobe some in IE, makes it hard to tell what you have open. i think overall the tasks are pretty clear, and I think some are intentionally left open to see what the response will be.Thanks!"

The chart shows Trim Install repairs and the list below lines up absences. It would appear that absences clearly cause repairs to increase. But something else I noticed was that you substituted for every absence except for 2: March 10 (not covered) and March 22 (Robin covered). All times you covered, we saw a spike in repair occurrences, while the two times you didn't cover, we didn't see any significant change.When you have to cover during absences, what are the challenges that arise that may cause these increases in repairs? I don't see the correlation to upticks when Larry is out, but more when anyone is out and you cover.For now, the next time you need to cover for absences, work with Larry or Robin to have them cover. I'd like them to audit what you are doing so we can help you improve when you do have to cover in the future. We can discuss more when I return.Thanks,Jamie",NA,"JJ,I appreciate your initiative in researching and suggestion for the process improvement for turntable proposal. However, there is some concern with taking company information outside using it within your statistics class.Confidential information must remain within the company so we can keep our IP from other companies. Based on what you've told me, I believe you were unaware of this policy. However, in the future, please do not take confidential company information.That being said, I believe your idea has some merit. Before you seek to place an order, we need to get engineering buy in. Since I will be out, work with Carson Spikes to identify a engineer on his team to evaluate your idea. We should make sure that there are no issues that weren't considered that could affect other processes.If he gives his approval, I'd like to meet with you before you place the order so I have all the details.Thanks,Jamie, Carson,Can you nominate an engineer on your team to evaluate this idea with JJ?

Say the next day Saturday April 16?This would allow you to roll the software out without any constraints to production.I don't see any formalized training prior to my team using the software on April 18.Since this software is described as very different from our current software, I have concerns with my team's ability to use it without any formalized trainingYour timeline does cover training of the finished software during the week of May 2nd, but I feel that we need some formalized training on the differences with this new version prior to the April 18th rollout.Can you put together a training session for my team on Thursday April 14th? I also want them to be able to ask questions so the implementation goes as smoothly as possible.Please work with my team leads (Robin, Pat, & JJ)to schedule the training time.I'd like to meet with you on April 22nd to discuss the issues my team finds after the initial rollout so we can be on the same pages about what was found and how we can address these issues.I look forward to working closely with you to rollout these process improvements in final assembly.Thanks,Jamie,",NA,NA,NA,"Vic,I believe this may be a misunderstanding. Please do not take action at terminating JJ at this time.JJ is taking statistics classes at night, and it appears he was using this data in a case study to help improve our processes. While taking the data outside the company is a concern, I believe JJ may not have been aware of this policy. Based on his version of the story, I believe he meant well for the company and didn't think about the data sharing as an issue.I will follow up with JJ tomake sure JJ is aware thatremoving confidential information from the company is a serious issue, and he cannotdo this in the future. In addition, I will make sure to communicate to my team that all company confidential information is to remain inside the company.Thanks,Jamie,","I did not handle these in order.

Once the meeting data came in, I spent a lot of time on those assuming that they if they were important enough to schedule a meeting for it was important to spend more time on them. After the meetings, I tried to address the bigger problems first, and didn't finish responding to all.Communication - it seems like groups work in isolation, not understanding the bigger picture.Morale - low due to lack of communication.

Tough situation to handle vouching for someone you haven't met.Professional conduct - important not just when others are present, but should be a priority all the time. Affects ability for company to complete sales. If left unchecked, the next audit could be much more of a problem.Team focus - needed to address the issues with scrap to keep yield high per Sequence methodLeast important emails:Kirkland plant - based on rumors; needed to get team's focus back on the job at hand.Victory lunch - didn't respond, ran out of time. This was important for morale, but at the same time I'm not sure I agreed with the results, and I think for morale, both should have gotten the lunch.The theft/turntable emails together clarified the situation, but didn't make it any easier to decide how to handle. I stood up for someone with very little information, not sure if that was the right thing to do.The warranty/Debby/Larry and Emiliy interactions all kind of clarified that SEQUENCE wasn't rolled out very well, morale was low because of it, people weren't listening to each other, and it was affecting productivity.

rlfKbVvWSjV,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"JJ,Its come to my attention that Larry Hodges is not in support of our SEQUENCE process. As you know, SEQUENCE was developed to provide more value to our customers and shareholders, by making the company more efficient and competitive in this market. I realize Larry has 20+ years of experience on the line, but he needs to realize that over that 20 years our competitive edge has dwindled. We currently rank third in Manufacturing Cost per unit, third in Sales growth and second in profitability, amongst our competitors. Its essential that we employee the SEQUENCE process for sustained growth and longevity in this business. Therefore, you need to have a coach & counsel session with Larry and let him know the company will continue to utilizethe SEQUENCE process, with him or without him. He needs to understand that his job is in jeopardy, just like everyone else's, if we don't see improvement in our market place.,",NA,"JJ,This is the first I've heard of issues with Debby, so let me ask a few questions;1) Being you are her direct supervisor, have you had anydiscussions, either formally or informallywith Debby on her absenteeism?

If not, you need to have a formal review with her on the roles, responsibilities and expectationsthat you have developed foryour ""Trim Install"" team.Passing Debby from one team to another is not helping her, nor us. Once you've established clear expectations with her, if she continues to be a problem then we need to look at other options, including potential termination. However, we need to get her the ability to prove us differently.

Please provide me with the following: documentation of counseling/coaching and corrective action, Debby's training jacket/documentation, record of absenteeism, and anything that might have been submitted to HR regarding her issues. In the meantime I want you to pair her up with one of your more experienced team members who can work with her to identify what work related issues she has and the associated training to fix the problem. Have this occur for a week's time to see if corrective action helps improve her productivity. Additionally, I want you to talk to her and see if she is having issues outside of work that is causing herabsenteeism and tohave bad days. If there is some other underlying issue we need to try to identify it to help her out. We need to ensure that she is properly trained and is not just being bounced from team to team. By doing that we are not giving her a fair chance to develop. I will inform Cory of the issue and this plan. If there continue to be issues after implementing this we will explore the option of moving her. Since I will be gone you can report any information regarding this situation to Cory until I return.Jamie","J.J.,You have identified a legitimate concern for EVERYONE who works at our facility. Despite their plant being old we cannot make the assumption that they are less skilled or intelligent. I want you to ensure that you have a reception plan in place for any Kirkland employee that we might receive to ensure that they are properly integrated into our team. We can't look at loading our team up with the best personnel simply because that will create imbalances in other areas of the plant.

He will be reviewing his team's training documentation and processes to identify why the amount of repairs need to occur on days when Larry is not at work. Once complete he will identify who needs additional training or re-training to correct the issue.Jamie J.J., I'd like for you to review the attached document and e-mail that Jennifer has provided me with. Also, I want you to gather all of your team's training documentation and review them. There seems to be a trend directly relating to Larry being gone and additional repairs needing to be conducted. As you can see from the pdf, our repairs were well above target far too often last month. We need to identify who needs additional or re-training to ensure that we reduce the amount of repairs being conducted as that has adverse effects on production. Once you identify the issue develop a plan of action to correct it.Jamie",NA,"J.J.,Great work on figuring out a way to improve the process that we currently have in place, it sounds like it will definitely make things more efficient.

Personnel: there were numerous instances in which employees behavior or lackluster performance had adverse effects on production or company image3. Process: although SEQUENCE appears to be a good system there is a lack of willingness for team members to accept it despite being official policy. Also, not enough feedback is being provided in a constructive manner to make it more effective.3. Training: there were several instances in which lack of training was blatantly obvious. Team members not being trained on equipment created waste and defects. Aside from actual work related duties there was no training on professional behavior in the workplace.3.

She also has the highest customer service rating of all the TPT workers (B+)and a good team work rating (B+).

I'm nominating Jess because in my opinion he already has the skills to be a level 2. In fact, he trained Chris Faulkner who is now a level 2.

So he will need to provide those things before he can receive reimbursement.","Thank you for informing me. However, are you certain he downloaded the files intentionally?","1. I think a major issue facing Customer Service Team 5 is the staffing of the installation team. Only having 6 people available is a major constraint. Another issue is training, in particular there needs to be a focus on quality and less emphasis on quantity. A number of service complaints seem to stem from the rep hurrying through the call.2. The quietPaper one message was probably my top priority. I felt like we had an obligation to get reinstallations done. The promotion message was the second priority. I felt it was important to get the right person, so the level 1 team could improve. Lastly, the two messages regarding harassment/inappropriate behavior. I'm a firm believer in the right to work in a professional environment. And I believe unacceptable behavior needs to be addressed quickly.3. I thought Barney's files and the emails regarding promotions, Taylor's backup, and Jess Rollins where all connected in that they were personnel issues. I relied heavily on Barney's notes, much more than i relied on the performance and productivity indexes.4. having an interactive installation schedule would have been nice. I found it difficult to see where later appointments could have been added. So i basically said they couldnt be done at this time or asked for a reschedule.

IklzzoYvsfy,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"JJthanks for the updates about your thoughts on Debby. I understand that her absenteeism can feel likea burden on the team. I hope you can have an appreciation for any ailments or personal issues that Debby is experiencing, and that if you were experiencing something similar, others might feel the same. As the Trim Install lead, I would like to challenge you to help her work through some of her issues using your wealth of experience. Instead of trying to move her to another group, and sending what you perceive as a ""problem"" to another department, lets try our hardest to become a valued and important member of Trim Install and Group A Line 1. Can you do that for me? I'll continue to keep an eye on her attendance, and will talk with her when I get a chance.Thanks in advance,Jamie., Karen Per the email below from JJ Paxton, he has noted that Debby Britzki has had multiple sick days. Can you provide information about her absenteeism? (Doctors notes, frequency, claims from other employees in the repair group?) I do not want to do as JJ suggests and pass her off to another group or department without understanding the situation. I don't have enough experience with the dynamics or history between her and JJ either, and would like to know if there is an issue there that I should be aware of. I would like to have this information available upon my return, and would like to have a meeting to discuss on April 21st. Please schedule at your convenience on that day.Regards,Jamie","JJ - I have not yet heard of the details of the Kirkland plant, but will keep my ears open, and keep your requests in mind as we proceed. Please keep in mind that we need to think of the greater good of Soundproof Solutions, and not just our Team/Area. Perhaps getting other employees might be great developmental task for you and I to undertake in developing them as successful members of our team.Thanks,Jamie.,",NA,"Cory - During my absence, can you please work with the team leaders to address the following issues in the Final Assembly Area:Solicit employee feedback on the SEQUENCE process. Based on everything I've heard today, the roll-out of the program may be lacking, and employees have not bought in to the process.Provide refresher training (coordinated with HR) about sexual harassment policies, and investigate the incident mentioned below during the tour. We need to apply our discipline policy if it is found to have occurred by an employee. I will not tolerate this in my department.Ensure that at end of shift, a different employee (on daily rotation) is assigned to check housekeeping, and work with employees to ensure the area is clean prior to everyone leaving.We can follow up on these upon my return,Jamie,",NA,NA,"Jennifer,Thanks for providing some information and feedback on Trim Install's repairs. I think it is important to identify the root cause of the issue. As you've noted, statistically the repairs are related to the days that someone in my department is away sick or on vacation. Another anomaly I've noted is that when JJ fills in on these absence days, we see a increase in the number of repairs, yet when Robin Moskowitz filled in for JJ on the 22nd, we remained below the target of 3 repairs. This is only one day, so it could be a statistical anomaly, but I'm going to start cross training Robin, JJ, and even Pat as team leaders of a different group. Perhaps we'll see that JJ could benefit from leading adifferent team, and that Robin is a better fit for Trim Install. While I see that Larry's absence on the 8th and 14th were higher than normal, I did notice there were multiple days when we had abnormally high repairs.Additionally, we may find that Trim install is understaffed and needs an additional person so the impact is reduced when one is out sick. By cc'ing her on this e-mail, I'm asking Karen Devalier to conduct a manpower study on our Group A Line 1 and perhaps you or Emily Carlson can assist, and if we justify another person we'll proceed with Management's approval.Regards,Jamie,",NA,"JJYour enthusiasm for improving our trim installation is very apparent. It sounds like you have done some great work Paul and Emily on something for us. Before you proceed, please confirm that we have adequate budget to cover this expense. You can call Barrett Remini to confirm.To fully cover our bases, lets ensure that our legal, HR and Area manager are okay with you taking data home and allowing the statistics classmates to review and manipulate the data. I'd hate for there to be a misunderstanding about your intentions with the data, or to have the data be released to a competitor. Upon my return, I'd like to meet to discuss this, and develop a plan for installation and implementation (pending Barrett's budget approval.) Lets meet on Monday April 25th.Regards,Tom,","Issac,Thanks for contacting me. I appreciate you preparing a proposed plan, but feel that we should reorganize the sequence and tweak the timeline a little. I would like to schedule training of the software with my employees prior to installing and testing it. While I recognize the software training will be incomplete until we reach the final release of the software, the employees won't be able to adequately use or assess it without prior training. I'm afraid we'd get some bad information and feedback that would be unproductive. Complete initial training the week of April 11thInstall the software on the 16th over the weekend so we minimize production interference during the week.April 18-22nd - employees use the software and provide feedback.April 25-29: We will make changes to the software to correct problems found by your team. May 2: We will officially roll out the new software for your team to use. Week of May 2-6: We will train your team on using the software now that it is complete.This keeps us on the same timeline overall, but requires your group to provide some earlier training and do the install on the weekend.Please confirm this is okay. I've cc'd my team leaders and Quality Process Coordinator to give them a heads up of my proposed changes.Regards,Jamie,",NA,"Paul - investigating the results below, I feel that the use of the averages may beshifted a little in Pat's favor, and may not be as clear of a winner as thought. three of the questions seek a lower score for an ideal leader, not a higher (questions 4, 7 and 11) hopefully have results leaning to a lower score vs. a higher...and JJ won those. I think we should consider BOTH equal and reward both of them with a lunch. Perhaps both will continue with friendly competitiveness, and if we use the results to provide them feedback for future development, both will continue to evolve into better future leaders. Cory - Please take both JJ and Pat to lunch on the 7th!Regards,Tom,",NA,"Vic - Please stop immediately on your plan to confront JJ, escort him out, and terminate him. I do not believe that you have conducted a full and thorough investigation, nor followed a company process for termination. I need to investigate the issue and work with our human resources to determine a path forward.Karen - Please see the information in this e-mail.Tom,  Karen - I believe we need to address an issue with the Plant Security Supervisor immediately. He sent this e-mail today, a week after the date of observing his allegations against JJ. He did not communicate this to an appropriate party in a reasonable timeframe, is making decisions on personnel employment issues without consultation of management or HR, searching employee's personal belongings without his knowledge, and this could lead to potential liability for wrongful termination of an employee. However, we should treat his accusations seriously and investigate the issue. Being new to the company, and not knowing what projects or work Paul had JJ working on, I don't know if JJ has violated company policy or is just being a hard worker and doing a little after hours research. Please coordinate an investigation immediately, and use a impartial Manager from a different department that does not have a work or personal history relationship with JJ or Vic. This needs handled immediately. I've asked JJ to report to my office at 11:45, and will inquire about any work he is doing after hours and try to determine if this is a misunderstanding or if JJ is breaking policy.Tom","1.) I did not always handle the items in the order in which I received them. I felt thatsome were more important and required immediate response, while others could be delayed until later in the day.I didtry to handle the non-urgent ones in sequence so they aligned with the meeting schedule.2.) Major problems facing final assembly include: communication with other departments; employee diversity of opinions/ideas/backgrounds, past relationships affecting normal processes, apprehension of new programs being implemented at the company. 3.) The communication with other departments is an issue because it is leading to production disruptions for both departments that hurt the company and facility's profits and success. The lack of employee appreciation for diversity is leading to friction between new/old employees, employees with different backgrounds, and employees who've been tasked with different priorities by the facility/company management. The past relationships between the prior manager and employees in other groups has led to walls being built and communication falling apart. The roll-out of the SEQUENCE program may not have been done as well as it could have been, and is leading to apprehension of employees who've been through roll-outs before and feel this is a fad. Additionally, they aren't seeing the long term benefits of the program.----Original Message-----From: Assessment Administrator Sent: 4/5/2016 2:20 PM To: Pace, Jamie Cc: Subject : About your day (1 of 2) This e-mail and the one that follows contain some final questions for you.

I see critical as something that need addressed immediately, while important means the scope of the problem had a quantifiable risk that is separate from the timeline. I felt the JJ Paxton theft issue was important because someone was potentially getting fire today! (both important and critical) The SEQUENCE grumblings were important because they have a long term effect on the entire organization. The Professional conduct almost slipped my mind on my to do list because I didn't know how to handle it immediately with the constraints of this test, yet I feel that a sexual harassment issue is intolerable and requires immediate action.It was hard to keep up with all the names and organizations, but yes, I used thing like the schedule, Performance survey of Pat and JJ, and Group A Trim Install Repairs information as background for numerous issues.Original Message-----From: Assessment Administrator Sent: 4/5/2016 2:21 PM To: Pace, Jamie Cc: Subject : About your day (2 of 2) Following are some of the e-mails that you received today, along with some questions about how you approached them.

I would encourage you to speak with her to see if maybe she has a reason for her poor performance. I will address the issue of absenteeism with her but I think you should speak with her to make sure she has the proper training to be successful in her position. Her poor performance could be due to her being bounced from team to team so lets approach it a little different this time and see if maybe she has a specific reason for her poor performance.

To me the common denominator in the days where we had excess repairs was J.J. filling in and not so much Larry not being on the line. I have confidence that J.J is doing a good job of filling in but maybe we need to look at using someone else to fill in if we have someone available which will in turn allow J.J. to be more available for concerns throughout the area.

Did you handle each challenge in the order you received it, or did you handle them another way? Please describe your approach. I started by just handling them in the order that I received them but am wondering now if I should have maybe opened everything as it came and tried to get the quick ones done first and go back to the ones that took a little more time. 2. Please list the major categories of issues or problems facing Final Assembly in the Bridgeport facility of Soundproof Solutions. There was concern with some absenteeism as well as the process of covering for the absenteeism. There was also concern over some employees ability to due there job on a daily basis. There was also some concern of an influx of new employees from another facility. 3. Describe why each entry in Question 2 is an issue or problem. Employees being at work when they are scheduled to be is crucial to the entire operation. When someone is gone then people are having to be moved from their normal jobs in order to cover for the absent employee which can lead to people doing jobs that they might not be 100% comfortable in doing which can lead to errors or even injuries.It is the employers duty to make sure every employee is properly trained for the job that they are performing in order to allow them to perform that job to the best of their abilities. The influx of new employees caused some concern in part to a lot of people are just not comfortable with change. People tend to get comfortable in their positions and the thought of change is scary to them. It is the employers job to help the employees deal with changes in a way that makes everyone involved comfortable, both new employees and veterans.Original Message-----From: Assessment Administrator Sent: 4/5/2016 12:30 PM To: Pace, Jamie Cc: Subject : About your day (2 of 2) Following are some of the e-mails that you received today, along with some questions about how you approached them.

I believe the 3 most important were the ""turntable email"", the interaction between Larry and Emily and the professional conduct email 2. Why did you feel that the e-mails you rated as most important were critical? I think the turntable email was critical because it involved employees going above and beyond their everyday jobs to make improvements. I think that needs to be acknowledged and the employees should know that there hard work is appreciated. The interaction between Larry and Emily was important because I think the issue is a common issue in workplaces today. The younger generation and older generation don't always see eye to eye and trying to get them to understand each other is huge for a business in moving forward from one generational work force to the next. The professional conduct email was critical because as a business you have to understand that you are nothing without your customer. A few bad seeds and some poor judgement can be enough to lose business and that can never be tolerated. I think one of the most difficult jobs a superior can have in the workplace is keeping everyone's attitudes positive but it is also one of the most crucial for a lot of different reasons and this email touched on one of the big ones. 3.

Well, to be completely honest I cant really think of this being the case with the emails that I was able to make it through. I was kind of unsure how long these challenges where going to take so I wasn't sure if the best way to attack them was to try to be fast and efficient and try to make it through all of them or just take my time and try to be as thorough as possible.

Please list the major categories of issues or problems facing Final Assembly in the Bridgeport facility of Soundproof Solutions.There seems to be many employee related issue from potential data theft to people not getting along. The interaction between the different groups and even inside themselves is not positive. Communication seems to be lacking on important items such as the reason for the SEQUENCE initiative. Also employees seem to be more worried about others actions than their own. Leadership and guidance is missing. Paul does not seem to have been the best at a leadership role as the operation is just going along with no real driver for perfection.Working culture is not goodLacking true leadershipPoor communicationDistrust amongst different teamsSome employees are doing everything themselvesPossible data theft, fighting and other inappropriate behaviors are taking placeEmployees do not feel supported or listened too3. Describe why each entry in Question 2 is an issue or problem.All of the items mentioned in question 2 will drive the overall production of any organization. Employees need to feel valued, a part of the team, have an understanding of changes, and be treated with respect. The success of the organization relies on the dedication of the overall team.  1. What were the three most important and the three least important e-mails to handle?Most Important: Professional conduct: Salesperson unnerved by team member behavior during customer tour  Theft of company information: J.J. Paxton is suspected of stealing company-confidential information Warranty claim: Request for a plan to investigate warranty claims for a customers new unitsLeast Important: Kirkland plant: Concern about team members transferring from an older plant Suggestion box: Proposal for an incentive plan to increase team members suggestions Victory lunch: Al and Paul will buy lunch for the group leader with better performance survey results 2.

Did you handle each challenge in the order you received it, or did you handle them another way? Please describe your approach.I attempted to handle each email in the order in which it was received. However, after seeing that some emails needed more detail than others, Iprioritized which ones would be the quickestand most important to answer, and created a mental order for which ones needed to be answered first. 2. Please list the major categories of issues or problems facing Final Assembly in the Bridgeport facility of Soundproof Solutions.Employee moraleProfessional ConductPolicies and procedures3. Describe why each entry in Question 2 is an issue or problem.With the implementation of SEQUENCE, it seems that employee morale has dropped substantially. I believe this increase in morale causes some employees to be unsatisfied with their jobs, which is then reflected in the rest of their work. If we can fix the employee morale, we may see employees behaving better and treating each other with more respect.There were a few instances where employees seemed to act with little/no regard of the established policies and procedures. For example, regarding the theft of company property/information, each employee should be trained annually and sign a form of acknowledgment after reviewing the policies and procedures. Keeping confidential company information confidential is one of the main reasons that the company is doing so well in the noise reduction market. Employees need to understand this and be disciplined if they choose to break this rule.

As the team leader have you discussed the teams concerns with her? Do you have any other solutions besides moving her to another team? Your team does a great job and I think with the right solution Debby can be a productive part of it. Let me know your thoughts and I will set up a meeting with Debby to discuss the issues and figure out our path forward.Thanks,Jamie,","J.J.,I can't speculate on whether we will be getting employees from the Kirkland facility. If this does happen we cannot allow teams to hand pick who they want. I appreciate that you are concerned about trying to train new individuals and not slow down production but I think you've done an excellent job up to this point at getting employees trained. If this does happen, I think we should handle the new employees like we do any other new employee. Let's try not to speculate on a person's abilities before we've given them an opportunity.

Please describe your approach.At first I handled them how I received them but then I had to prioritize them based on importance. Some issues were time sensitive and required immediate attention. Since I was going to be out for two weeks they needed to be done quickly. Some issues required more thought. For instance J.J. stealing information and Larry/Emily confrontation.2. Please list the major categories of issues or problems facing Final Assembly in the Bridgeport facility of Soundproof Solutions.Final assembly seems to be the guinea pig for every thing new coming in. SEQUENCE started there and then the robot software update. There seems to be issues with quality which may be due to the desire to do everything so quickly. There also seems to be personality conflicts within the group. Absenteeism is also a problem. Trim Install seems to have the most issues. 3. Describe why each entry in Question 2 is an issue or problem.Employees get frustrated when they are always the one first to try a new thing first. It messes up their rhythm and production. People struggle with change and will fight it. Trim install has issues with quality, personality conflicts, and absenteeism. This affects quality and production. They seem to have the most issue with the SEQUENCE program and are not buying into it. They will eventually start to effect other teams.

Paxton is suspected of stealing company-confidential information1. What were the three most important and the three least important e-mails to handle?Theft of company information was important because J.J. was going to be fired. Information needed to be quickly gathered so the situation could be dealt with by the end of the day. That is someone's livelihood and you need all the facts to make that decision.Victory lunch was also important because the lunch was being held in two days and I only had today to deal with it. It is also important to respond quickly so employees see follow through. You can't say you are going to do something and then not do it.Software upgrade was also important because it dealt with time sensitive stuff as well. I needed to have that pushed back and set in stone before I leave for two weeks.Debby wasn't as important as the others because it wasn't time sensitive and work didn't stop if I didnt' get it answered quickly. Suggestion box falls under the same lines. It is an idea we want to implement. There isn't a rush on it. Kirkland plant was based off rumors. it's important to address those things but not to stop production to do so. 2. Why did you feel that the e-mails you rated as most important were critical?They were time sensitive or showed follow through. I think it is important for employees to see that you actually do what you say you will. 3.Todays assessment provided you with background information about Soundproof Solutions and also presented thechallenging messages listed above.

This is a very sad thing. FYI, It is my understanding that JJ was doing research to install a turn table type operation to help with the installation of the panels on our noise breakers. I agree that he should not be taking any information home that is proprietary. If this is our policy that he be removed then he should be removed. If you feel that maybe this was research associated with his ideas then maybe we can have a discussion with him and make sure he does not take company property off-site. He may have been doing this research with the backing of Paul but I do not know for sure.I will work with Cory to come up with a suitable replacement for JJ.

Did you handle each challenge in the order you received it, or did you handle them another way? Please describe your approach.I tried to read as many emails as I could and then respond. It helped toward the end because I was able to put a few issues together and make adjustments to the items that I was working on responding to. I was making some decisions to move people around then I was finding that I had real issues with that person. In general I was taking care of them in order, but there was the one with the software install that I needed time to figure out how I was going to respond and then there were some others that were simple responses that I could address immediately. I also wanted to make sure that I addressed all of Cory Mannings stuff since he was my boss..2. Please list the major categories of issues or problems facing Final Assembly in the Bridgeport facility of Soundproof Solutions.There is a real issue with communication between all the groups, I felt like it was each group against the other.There is a problem with diversity and inclusion, most of what I saw was an age thing. The older folks are continuing to do things the way they always have, and they treat others with little or no respect. Everyone seems to be out for themselves, it is not really a team atmosphere. We need to build the team spirit and develop everyone to start working for the common good of the company.3. Describe why each entry in Question 2 is an issue or problem.Communication is critical for any organization. we are getting pushback from some of the older folks because they simply do not understand what the company is trying to accomplish. Pat gave me the impression that he did not actually know where our company ranked with quality, we need to inform the employees so that they will strive to be the best of all companies, not just in their plant!Respect is an issue, diversity and inclusion, without the proper respect and inclusive nature a company today cannot survive. Each person has a job to do and if we can respect them it will make their job easier and more satisfying. Larry was very disrespectful of Emily and you could feel the frustration. Not a good working environment.A company cannot thrive with everyone only looking out for themselves. This was evident in many of the role playing exercises. We must be one team in the end and our company will be much better. We need to strive to make the entire plant better which will lead to a better company in the long run.Original Message-----From: Assessment Administrator Sent: 4/5/2016 2:21 PM To: Pace, Jamie Cc: Subject : About your day (2 of 2) Following are some of the e-mails that you received today, along with some questions about how you approached them.

I still needed him to step up though and make a change and provide feedback to Cory with our quality issues.The professional conduct issue was very concerning and more that came up about JJ I felt that he was more part of the problem than I had hoped for. But, when I got the security notice, I really felt that he was done!"

Paxton is suspected of stealing company-confidential information1. What were the three most important and the three least important e-mails to handle?I feel that the top three most important e-mails are in order. 1. Vic Daisha about JJ Paxton with the concern of Theft of Company Information. I feel this is the most important due to the potential of the security of the company and it needs immediate attention. 2. I feel that the issue with the Warranty Claim is second in priority due to product quality issues and could affect other customers. This problem needs to be addressed to assure we do not have an ongoing issue. 3. The one that I feel would be third is the Professional conduct (Alex Norman). I feel this is important and needs to be addressed. This could affect our operation and needs immediate attention. I feel the bottom three in order in: 1. Victory lunch (Paul Bern). I felt this ranks the lowest in priority due to not having a current impact on todays operation. 2. The second would be the Suggestion box (Cory Manning) I feel this is a good idea but it ranked low in todays e-mails. 3. The one I felt was third to least importance would be the e-mail dealing with Job Rotation. This is a good idea but compared to todays emails I feel it ranks near the bottom. 2. Why did you feel that the e-mails you rated as most important were critical?I feel that all of the e-mails that I received today are important but it is important to be able to prioritize to keep from getting distracted from completing a task that needs immediate attention by something that can wait. That is why I prioritized the e-mails in the order that I did.3.Todays assessment provided you with background information about Soundproof Solutions and also presented thechallenging messages listed above. Were there situations where information from one source/challenge helped you to better understand and address anotherchallenge? If so, please list specific examples of theseinstances (Example: Message X related to Message Z, Company Policies related to Message Y, etc.).I feel that with JJ Paxton his e-mails set the tone on what angle he was taking and it also set the tone that he might looking very critical at the company and those around him.I also feel the information passed on about PatLandis was very useful. There was other information about production for the month of march that helped to explainissue in assembly.Such as moral the e-mail about the suggestion box made it clear about the company moral, and the email from Paul Bern about the award."

Regardless, I will address the situation.Thanks for the data. From my quick look, it appears that regardless of which team member is out, the rework has gone up.

Do we have any documentation to back the issues up that you have stated in your email below. J.J. have we done any coaching to help Debby out? Do you have any ideas on how we can help her through those bad days she is having so the rework rates arent high. Over the next 2 weeks while i am on vacation, please work on coaching her and making her a better employee. i expect documentation on her performance and absente issues when i return. If you have any concerns over this please dont hesitiate to reach out to me. We havce to set Debby up for success and just ""dumping"" her to another team is not the answer. Thanks, Jamie Pace,",NA,NA,"J.J.Please read the following email below from Mr. Norman and the complaints regarding your crew. This needs address immediately with the following employees alone and the whole team needs talked to during the beginning of the next shift.

I understand people will get sick and have emergencies come up outside of work. But i see a trend on the days that we have someone out, you are stepping in to replace him/her. Please explain why when you are back filling for your people, repairs are higher on those days. J.J., this puts a negative look on us and you need to step it up during that time. If you have any ideas how to resolve people from just calling off to call off if thats what is going on. Or an idea that i can help in any way to make production smoother during the times of someone being absence. I will be gone for the next 2 weeks and when i return, we will meet on the month of March repairs and compare them to April. I expect big things out of you here at soundproof solutions.THanks, Jamie Pace",NA,"JJ, This sounds great and i like the ideal of this.

It seemsit will be a test run during that time, so it might not that big of a deal. I will contact my team leaders and make sure they are ok with this. While i am out of town starting april 6th-20th, contact Cory Manning on april 18 and 19th with any issues. i have contacted Cory and he is aware of this.

Resistance change is the reason many initiatives failQuality issues: The amount of repair work and customer complaints is getting high. Quality shouldbe top priorityin any manufacturing environmentInappropriate behavior: The behavior by the employees during tours is absurd, that type of behavior should not be tolerated and should be met with disciplinary action.

kzWRHgnZDfH,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"JJ,It sounds to me that the answer in the past has been to move the problem rather than to address it or find out the underlying cause. I would like for you to discuss the issues that you see with her explaining how this impacts the line.Part of your job as a team lead is to be there for your team not only in absence or breaks, but also to give directionon personal issues. If you open up the lines of communication you may be able to help her situation and point her to HR for professional help if needed.Personal problems- She may need someone to just listen. Listen to her, give your opinion if asked, and then explain that you are empathetic to her situations but they need to be left outside of work. Attendance/Tardiness- This directly impacts your duties for the day and takes away from much needed breaks from her co-workers.

However we have all been there and Ifeel that if we do get some of these individuals that we have the best in our department as far as training is concerned.

I think that you may be on to something, and I think that Haley would be interested in seeing these results as well.However, before we push to make a policy change with the other reps we should run some more analysis so that we can normalize the databy having a bigger sample size. I think that by continuing to gather data, we can get a better big picture view. If you would be interested in coordinating these efforts with the other customer service reps, I will let you be in charge of reporting all findings, and if the initial trend continues I think a policy change could be implemented. Thanks again for your hard work in gathering this data, and for thinking outside the box!Cary",NA,NA,"If you're confident that Jerry can handle the role for a couple of days, I'm good with allowing it.The one thing I will require is that if there is anything he is unsure about, he should defer to Kim. Let her knowyour plan, and it would probably be a good idea to meet with both she and Jerry together so you're all on the same page as far as expectations, workload, etc. If any questions arise for Jerry, I want him to go to Kim for help, but I also wanthim to share some ideas of his own.ThanksCary",I will address this immediately. Thank you for bringing it to my attention.Cary,"Haley,I think this promotion should go to Blaine. In my phone conversation with Jess a little bit ago, I told him that productivity can be sacrified if it leads to an improvement in performance. I believe that Blaine's high performance score coupled with the productivity exceeding our standard make Blaine the right choice.I value performance and customer satisfaction above volume. I think that keeping our customers satisfied allows us to retain them, as well as draw new business. And while timely responses are desirable, I personally feel that how we interact with customers is more important than when we interact with customers.",NA,NA,"I would like to schedule Jess Rollins for the CS2BASIC course. In our phone conversation earlier, he expressed a desire to advance, and I think this would be a good opportunity for him to get closer to that end.I'd like to sign Blaine Lerner up for the CS2IM course. He has excellent scores in both performance and productivity and I believe he's earned an opportunity to advance.I'd also like to sign Eden Webb up for the CS2BASIC course. Her productivity is through the roof, but I think she could benefit from the customer service portion of the basic course to help bring up her performance rating.",NA,NA,"Taylor,Thank you for bringing this to my attention, and I agree that we should do something about this as soon as possible. However, I don't think thatcollecting handwriting samples is the best course of action. I think that by meeting with everyone individually and letting them know that we should respect our coworkers and their cultures, and let the guilty party know that an apology should be issued to Eluto, and that no further action will be taken, unless this becomes a repeated pattern, in which case further action will be necessary, up to and including termination. I get that a little friendly ribbing may occur from time to time, but there's a line when it becomes too much. I think that meeting with the team to discuss this would go a long way to handling the issue.ThanksCary",NA,"Taylor,I agree with you. This is an unusually high number of 'defective' rolls to be limited to a single contractor. The logical conclusions are that he is in fact cheating us, or he's the unluckiest contractor in the world. I have no problem with letting him continue to make orders with us, but he should also be made aware that if he requires new rolls to replace defective ones, he will have to abide by our replacement policy. He will be able to receive a non-defective product, but he will also need to return the defective roll. Our staff has the power to use their own discretion, and I think that this continued pattern is enough to raise a red flag. Thank you for bringing this to my attention.Cary","I appreciate you bringing this to my attention. I'm not sure what the exact company policy in this instance is, but I think we should at least wait to get his full explanation, and to consult with HR before determining a final course of action. I think there could be some negative impact to taking that course of action, just based on what you described below. Again, I'd have to review the full company policy on this before doing anything permanent.ThanksCary","1. I'd say the biggest issue is that there doesn't seem to be a standard way of operating. Depending on who I spoke with or emailed with, it seemed all representatives were doing things a little differently.2. First, the issue with employees and their behavior toward fellow employees and with potential clients being within earshot of unprofessional behavior. Second, our big client, Fletcher Systems. Larger clients tend to take priority. And 3rd, the issue with the security guard and the confidential information. 3. In the message from the security guard, I didn't initially consider the information from the accused (because I forgot it was the same person who did the statistics report). Also, when devising the schedule on the calendar, I had to take pretty much every installation combination into account.4. I thought this was very comprehensive, and I can't think of anything that could be added.Thanks!Cary"

ACsMxKxdwMM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"J.J and Karen,I can understand your concern about Debby however; I have a few concerns of my own. I would like more information on what we have done to counsel Debby with her issues. From what I can see she has been shifted throughout the facility based on her problems instead of being dealt with. Sending Debby somewhere else will not help the company as a whole, or herself so please take the time to find out the following:Quality concerns: Is Debby trained efficiently, do we have the resources and the appropriate trainer that is spending time to decrease our FTQ (quality) issues? If we have these in place then an evaluation must take place to show that Debby is trained, and able to perform the tasks.If she shows that she is trained, and she feels that she is trained and not performing after that, then we must follow through with disciplinary actions.Human Resources-Karen,Can you please check on the absenteeism issues that are talked about with Debbie. We should have a policy to follow and progress with disciplinary actions if she is not abiding by our absenteeism policy. What I would like to see first is if she is in need of some outside counseling or help with her personal issues. Is this affecting her job? Does she need a leave of absence to deal with these issues? I feel first and foremost that we need to make sure that the atmosphere within the facility is adequate for her capabilities, and to make sure that she does not need help on the outside.If Debby feels that she is okay, we need to proceed with disciplinary measures and counsel her on the appropriate expectations for being at work, and working methods.I will set up a meeting with the two of you to discuss the outcome of what I have asked for you to follow up with when I return.Thank you,Corey","J.J.,I can make some calls to go over what experiences the associates have, and how it will impact our facility. I feel if we have adequate standardize work methods, appropriate training, and discipline we can overcome any obstacles with new associates. Developing associates should be embraced. Sequence should be a part of our everyday lives, so eventually they will get used to this process as if it was part of their job detail. We can discuss later when this happens, and address any issues at that time.I appreciate your concerns, please keep me posted of any others you may have.Cory",NA,"Team,Please read the message below and have a meeting with all associates on the appropriate behavior that is expected within this facility. I want to also let everyone know that this is a huge embarrassment and will not be tolerated. My expectation is that all (salary included) associates are disciplined for this type of behavior. Regards,Cory",NA,"Shea,Please provide breakfast on August 21st from 7-8am, and I will arrange to have my team there.Thanks,Cory","Jamie,I need you to look at this data and provide an answer to me on why this line is sufferingso much please. Where is the scrap coming from? Training, substitutions, morale, why? Also, If it's true what Jennifer is implying about whenLarry is absent, then why isn't Larry the lead? We shouldn't be having issues when the lead is filling in as a substitute. J.J. Paxton needs to be evaluated as wellto make sure he isn't becoming complacent in his role. Perhaps he is missing some type of training, or is not happy about this absenteeism and having to cover all of the time.Make sure a contingency plan is in order when you have absenteeism. This will help with morale of the group. We need to find out why so many people are missing work. I will be sending a separate email including others on some more objectives to follow through with.Regards,Cory",NA,"Team,I have some concerns regarding the trim department as a whole. I do not want to order the turntable at this point in time until I return from vacation. The reason being is as follows:Turntables: I am very happy to see that we are offering a decrease in cycle time but I need the answers to these questions:Is it going to decrease scrap?Does it attack health and safety such as ergonomic issues?What is our payback from investingin the turntables? How much is the project vs the money saved incycle timeScrap: What are we doing to attack the scrap issues? We can decrease cycle time but if we are causing more issues at final inspection, and rejecting and eating the costs thenin reality we are spending money and not saving it.I would like to have a meeting when Ireturn. April 21, @8:30am. Meanwhile I need the4 of you to come up with the answers to these questions through our smartchange system. Team,I am interested always in ways to improve our cycle time in our processes however; I feel we are getting ahead of ourselves and not addressing another serious issue and that is our scrap from the last month. Before we order anything else, I would like to make sure we are addressing through smartchanges the following:Turntable: it will decrease cycle time, but what will it do with the scrap issue? Can we show a decrease in scrap because it will allow the associates to be focused on detail and job rather than moving around?What can we get for our money in the entire process? I don't want to throw money at a turntable if it doesn't meet all the measurable of our smartchange system. Does it decrease cycle time?, Does it decrease scrap? Does it resolve ergonomic or health/safety issues? We can have a meeting as soon as I get back about ordering product. It will only be 2 weeks away, and this will give the team enough time to work together to come up with the answers. Please work with quality, JJ Paxton, Sam Washington on how this process as a whole can be redefined.Meeting will be set for 8:30am April 21st to discuss.Thank you,Cory Team,I am interested always in ways to improve our cycle time in our processes however; I feel we are getting ahead of ourselves and not addressing another serious issue and that is our scrap from the last month.

Paxton is suspected of stealing company-confidential information1. What were the three most important and the three least important e-mails to handle?Important: Quality concerns-have to meet customer demands. If we don't we will not have business. It also teaches us to keep looking for continuous improvements in our processes and see where they are failing.Important: People issues in every area. I feel accountability is a huge factor in a work place. People who do the most usually are asked the most, and accountability is only put on them because they deliver results. I also feel that for the most part our workforce needs to be content and happy to have a better result overall. I am disciplined, and require people to be disciplined but don't agree with people being miserable. I also feel that most of our issues are ""people problem"" issues. There are many personalities to mix in a workplace.Important: Trying to get done the list that my supervisor asks me to do. It is important that he knows his concerns are my concerns. Least important: HR telling me someone stealing from company. I think it should be handled by them, and then relayed to all of us.Least important: Job rotation, only because I feel that the lead should follow through and that should come from the team. Not that I don't believe in rotation, but many can argue with pros and cons being the same. Quality is better with experience, but yet quality can be stifled because of complacency. Ergonomics can be better with rotation, but education states that rotations affect everyone with injury and the job should be fixed. Some examples.Least important: Kirkland plant. If the training process are in place, adequate standardized work the group should be able to support any new comers.2. Why did you feel that the e-mails you rated as most important were critical?Details above3. Todays assessment provided you with background information about Soundproof Solutions and also presented thechallenging messages listed above.

The issues that Debbie is having should be correctable in your work area. We have policies in place that deal with these issues and that is how it should be handled. Please be more specific and identify the areas in which she is performing poorly and lets do the best to improve her in those areas. If she shows no improvement then I will begin to discipline her according to our policies but we are not going to move her for her current assignments.Thanks Jamie,","J.J., first of all I cannot confirm that we are getting any employees from Kirkland Plant but if we do then we will take the workers that are assigned to us and turn them into the best trim workers in the company. We will teach them the procedures and standards that we have in place here to make us a successful department and company.Thanks Jamie,",NA,"Thank you Norman for the information. I had no idea that this was the attitude of my crew. I agree that this needs to be immediately addressed with workforce. Our employees need to respect their coworker as well as any person that is brought into the plant. This is simply unacceptable and will not be tolerated. I will have a meeting with all the employees in the assembly line 1 to outline what is acceptable behavior and what the repercussions are of not following company policy.Thankyou for bringing this to my attention.Jamie, Karen, this is a recent email that I received from one of our salespeople. It outlines some unprofessional behavior that the employees have demonstrated. I would like to have a meeting before the next tour is scheduled and would like you to be there to help clarify the policies and behavior that is expected of our employees at all times. I will personally talk to the individuals that were mentioned in his emails and tell them how disappointed I am in their behavior and I expect much different attitude from them.

I will notify the workers and tell them that breakfast will be provided.Thank You Jamie,","Thanks Jennifer, the information that you have given me does show a trend that reflects an increase in repairs when we have an employee absent. It appears that more cross training may be what is needed in the area so when employees are covering other jobs they will be more qualified to do thatjob correctly. I will implement a cross training schedule upon my return from vacation. I would request from you more data that supports these findings. If I could get the repairs combined with the absentee report for the past year that would be greatly appreciated.Thanks Jamie,",NA,NA,"Isaac, thank you for the update. I am very excited for the new update to the system. With that being said, I am not comfortable with current timetable that you are presenting to me.

We will schedule the victory lunch after I return from my vacation. I would like to be there to celebrate with you.

Suspected abuse from client, if not handled directly this could lead to more suspected instances of abuse. Interpersonal issues within the work environment could contribute to low productivity, morale, and in some instance legal implications. Employees must be encouraged to be innovative but let this interfere with assigned duties. Productivity could decrease. Suspected theft of corporate property could lead to compromise of customer trust regarding their information in addition this could assist competing companies. Polices are in place to provide for a consistent resource on a companies work rules. 2.

Lack of commitment to SEQUENCE and absenteeismare the two most profound issues that exist. Performance issues with regards to individual performance (Robin, JJ and security most notably);production delays also exist including collaboration across other production areas. 3. Lack of commitment to SEQUENCE is a problem because it's crucial to the success of Bridgeport and employee buy-in is not consistent. Itwill ultimatelyreducethe effectiveness of the program. Absenteeism is a problem because it affects team morale as others feel the need to carry the additional load and itultimately impacts production, as seen on JJ's team. Production delays are occurring primarily because Final Assembly Line1 is not communicating and working effectively with the other groups.

As I stated before when talking with all my team members, my door is always open to discuss how we can all work together as one close knit unit.

The rest of the schedule can stay intact unless we run into issues during the trial run.Please let me know by the end of the day today.Thanks,Jamie,",NA,NA,NA,"Vic,Before you to this, I will need to discuss with HR. JJ has been working on a side project with Paul and Emily so the story you're hearing could be accurate.

I read through and examined each situation and some them needed reactions right away, some I needed to sit on for a bit. 2) Company thief of documents, JJ being an issue when he's filling in for other instead he doesn't think it's him, each Lead has issues with other Leads or employees, Communication issues between organizational groups needs work.3) The issue with the stolen work documents is hard to prove and has major legal issues/requirements. JJ will be a work in progress; up or out. The communication or relationship between leads and other employee groups is always an issue and requires constant oversight. The communication between work groups is the easiest issue to solve (typically) because to get to that level required dedication and time.-----Original Message-----From: Assessment Administrator Sent: 4/5/2022 2:20 PM To: Pace, Jamie Cc: Subject : About your day (1 of 2) This e-mail and the one that follows contain some final questions for you.

Theft of company information, has severe consequences from both sides (termination vs legal action if wrong). Professional conduct not only has legal implications, but also business impacts (word to mouth, business acumen, etc)3) J.J.'s emails made it clear that his personality was going to need additional managing.

If this is a first time occurence, we can think about giving a warning. I would value HR input in this.Please let me know if you have any questions on this and need to schedule a meeting with Tracy and HR.Thanks,Cary Stevens","1 .

But during down time inbetween the more important isues, I tried to make sure I was at least getting replies out to the less pressing matters.Team morrale very low, old scars from previous leadership and fences to mend because of it, people is front line leadership not being bought in to company values and path, personell issues with respect to others, absenteeism, and wrong doing.If morale is low production will suffer and people pay less attention which can cause safety cocerns as well. Mending fences can be difficult if past leadership left a lot of negative outlook from employees and other department leaders. If the frontline supervisors/leaders are not bought in and supporting the company vision/policies the things will never change, people look to them and react accordingly. Personell issues are always the toughest to deal with, you have to handle every situation differntly.

They were both good employees with somewhat poor attitudes. I think that after the first one with Robin that I just felt more confident in the last one with Pat.

I do have a concern that we only have two weeks of data to base the assumption that lower call times equals higher customer satisfaction.

I like that you have taken the initiative on this and would like to ask you to take this on as side project? Would you like to take this on as a project? If so, after we analyze a year's worth of data and it proves out your trend, I would like to work with you to put together a presentation for you to give to Haley.

The afore mentioned scores indicates he needs development in his leadership skills.A good leader is unbiased, communicates well, is accountable, and inspires others to achieve their personal best.

I committed to her I would sit down with her and help her plan a course of action for possible promotion.Thanks,Cary Stevens Customer Support Leader, Central District Soundproof Solutions",NA,NA,"Hi Slade,While I understand Eluto is understandably upset, I don't think that obtaining writing samples and comparing them to the note is the best approach.None of us (that I know of) are skilled in handwriting forensics and it has to potential to make the situation worse.One of our companies values is mutual respect - Soundproof Solutions associates treat each other with dignity and respect. I think an email to the team restating this value to them might be a good first step. I will be more than happy to work with you to draft such and email that addresses the situation. Please let me know what you think.We also need to keep really detailed documentation on any and all incidentslike this. We should make the documentation a factual as possible, leaving out our emotions.Thanks,Cary Stevens Customer Support Leader, Central District Soundproof Solutions",NA,"Good morning Taylor,Iappreciateyou bringing this matterto my attention.At first glance, it would appear that Mr. Weedleris running a scam on us. Before we make a final judgment, I would like for us to do a little more investigation into the situation. While it doesn't seem likely that 8 out of the last 9 orders had defective products, it is possible. Could you provide me with more information?1. What were the nature of the other complaints/returns?2. Mr. Weedler's order and return records for the last 3 years?3. Have we seen a similar trend with other contractors in Mr. Weedler's area?4. Any other information that you deem pertinent.Thanks,Cary Stevens Customer Support Leader, Central District Soundproof Solutions","Good afternoon Liang,Thank you for bringing this matter to my attention. Tracy is in a class that isusing live data for statistics. However you do bring up a good point as to weather or not this is a violation of company policy in regards to data.This should be turned over to HR for further investigation. I will contact HR for further instructions on how to handle this.Thanks,Cary Stevens Customer Support Leader, Central District Soundproof Solutions","Original Message-----From: Assessment Administrator Sent: 4/5/2022 1:25 PM To: Stevens, Cary Cc: Subject : RESPONSE REQUIRED: About your day This e-mail contains some final questions for you. Your answers to these questions will help in the evaluation of your performance by providing a better understanding of your approach and rationale. It is important that you provide complete and thorough answers to the questions below.For your reference, a list of messages you received today is shown after question 4.1. Please list the major categories of issues or problems facing Customer Service Team 5 of Soundproof Solutions. Why is each an issue or a problem?Maturity/Accountability, succession planning, and logical problem solving. Maturity/Accountability - issues we not handled on an adult level. There seemed to be logs of finger pointing and he said/ she said. A good example was the issue of drawing a stinky face on a peers lunch sack and then collecting handwriting samples to catch the perp.Succession planning - candidates for promotions and upgrades were not chosen very well and too little criteria. An example is Slade wanting Jerry to take over for him while he was gone, when it was very obvious Jerry lacked leadership and people skills.Logical problem solving - I refer back to the incident with the lunch. 2. What were the three most important messages you considered the highest priorities to handle? Why?1. QuietPAPER One - this impacted several customers and could have negative impact on our reputation and image of making a quality product. 2. Fletcher Systems - this is a major customer that we could lose and many mistakes were made. Being a major customer, losing them could have significant impact on our income and reputation.3. Theft of company data - with the major focus on protection of customer data and the damaging repercussions of loosing it, this was a big one. Tracy while seeming innocently using company data in a trending class, could also be releasing protected and confidential business information. 3. List specific examples (if any) of instances where you detected a relationship between two of the messages you received in your inbox. For example, when you decided how respond to one message, did you consider information provided not only in that message, but in other message(s)? The connection between the emails from Liang Chun and Tracy Hurdle. Liang's put a whole new spin on the previous email from Tracy and vice versa. Breach of company confidentiality didn't occur to me, until I read Liang's email.The connection between the emails from Haley Roth about bench strength and the email regarding Jess Rollins. If I had known about the classes Jess hadn't taken, I could have incorporated them into my talk with her.4. Describe what additional information you would have liked to have in order to have a better or clearer understanding of the messages and challenges presented to you today."
OVxLoVIrPZv,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Tracy,Thank you for sharing your finding from your statistics class project. Although your findings might suggest a higher satisfaction rate with the amount of time spent the customer, I do not feel as though this is enough to push for this type of change. Our main goal is customer satisfaction. Sometimes a quick phone call is all it takes to satisfy a customer, but other times it may take a little bit longer. It may be a more complex issue that takes more time for us to resolve. In any rate, we cannot take a small sample size and determine that it works that way all the time. Every call is different with different scenarios. I think we should hold off on sending this information to Haley right now. What you can do if you want to, is take a larger sample size and do the research on that. Then we can sit down and look over your findings and discuss what may or may not need tweaking from our side. I think until we have more research done we should leave things as it is. I would hate for us to promote quick calls if in the end we are not satisfying our customer's needs. We should stay on the phone with our customers as long as it takes to satisfy all their concerns and needs. We can certainly discuss this further if you would like. Thank you again for your work and your findings through your class project. Regards,Cary",NA,NA,"That sounds great! We'll give it a shot and see how it works out. Thank you,Cary",NA,"Haley,I've looked over the performance data that you sent. I've also had a chance to review some of Barney's personnel notes that he left behind. After taking notes for both, I believe that Ashley Payne should be the person to fill the full-time position. Although her performance index is not as high as Blaine or Eden's, her productivity index is still above 100%. Barney noted that Blaine works best under supervision, which I think would be an issue with being in the full time position. We need someone that can address customer needs without supervision. Barney also noted that Eden is quick, he is impatient and can be very sarcastic at times. Ashley has been noted by Barney as having a very sold understanding of the process and is an excellent worker. For these reasons, I believe she is the best suited to fill the full-time position. Thank you,Cary",NA,NA,Please see my 3 nominations below:1) Tracy Hurdle - completed all 3 classes and is a hard worker2) Sandy Martin - completed all 3 classes and is computer savvy3) Chandan Kumar - needs to take CS2BASIC; is good with technical problems and is a problem solver,NA,NA,"Taylor,Thank you for informing me of this situation. I believe the first course of action is that we need to send out an email to the entire Team 5 group. Please write up the email and lets inform our people that such behavior is insensitive to others and the company will not tolerate it. You can refer back to our ""Vision and Values"" of the company about Mutual Respect. Please put description of the mutual respect section in the email to refresh our employees memory and ask that they all be respectful to each other in the future. I think that by doing this, everyone will understand where we stand and that actions will be taken appropriately if these offenses continue to occur. I will also reach out to Eluto and Jody and discuss the situation with them and let then know that we are actively addressing the issue. Please send me a draft of your email and we can go over it before we send it out to the team. Let me know if you have any questions concerning this. Thank you,Cary",NA,"Taylor,Thank you for the information. Since Mr. Weedler is going to make another order in the near future, I think what we need to do is send a representative out to the site with the roll of quietPAPER 70 that is ordered. This way we can inspect the product to make sure that it meets Mr. Weedler's needs as well as gives us an opportunity to document what was ordered, the condition it was in when it was delivered and the approval of Mr. Weedler himself. With all this document in hand, we can address it with Mr. Weedler if/when he calls us with another complaint. Then we can pursue a meeting with Mr. Weedler if he has a complaint and present out records to him for review. Let me know if this sounds good to you. Thank you,Cary.","Liang,It is true that Tracy was doing research on customer service. I appreciate your concern on our security, but I must request that you bring these concerns to me or the appropriate management personnel first before taking any action. The confusion could have been discussed and cleared and all parties would have better understanding and knowledge. In the future, when you have any concerns or questions about possible security wrongdoings from my employees, please come to me first and we can address it in the proper manner. We would hate to jump to conclusions before we know all the facts. Thank you for your understanding.

I have just been informed by Tracy that she's working on the data for her statistics class andplans to use it to improve our operations.

Since he is TPT, it is good to start with CS2BACIS course first.3) Representative: Blaine LernerTraining:CS2IMReason: Since I have nominate Blaine Lerner to be promoted into full time, I think its good to send him to this CS2IM training toimprove his competency more. Besides, this training also for him to up skill. Besides the reason for each person that I wrote, I am also concern on the 3 staffs (Tracy Hurdle, Sandy Martin and Quinn Labarre)that already undergo all three training.

I will be your contact in the Information Technology department. Anything to do with the programming of production machinery is handled exclusively by my team. Please let me know of any programming needs you have and I will do my best to satisfy them. I have been talking with Al Howard about our new robot programming software. It should help make adjusting the robots and switching between programs much faster than before. Further, your team members will be able to make some adjustments to the robots directly, without involving Engineering or Maintenance. This will save both time and money, and has been approved by both Engineering and Maintenance. It is definitely very different from the current software in place. Al agreed that your group will be the test site for the entire company as we try to get the software finalized. Here is the rollout plan I propose. Please note these dates.Friday April 15: Install the software. We will need a full day to install and configure the software. The installation is automated, and will be done over the networkno one will need to go to your plant. However, we will need to take the current system down while we do this. We will remove your existing software at this time as well, since we are replacing it.April 18-22: Your staff will use the software and report any issues to you. You will send the reports to me and I will act on them. April 25-29: We will make changes to the software to correct problems found by your team.May 2: We will officially roll out the new software for your team to use.Week of May 2-6: We will train your team on using the software now that it is complete. I talked this over with your team leaders and they had no concerns, but they asked that I take it up with you to confirm that we may go forward with this plan. Note that we are very flexible, so please get back to me by the end of the day with any changes you propose to make to this plan or schedule. However, Al wants to get moving within a week.IsaacIsaac TecniovManager, Information Technology",NA,"Hi Paul, I will let J.J. and Pat know. Thanks., Hi Corey,What a great idea. I reviewed the survey and both did great but the winner was Pat. He did a good job making decisions, connecting with team members, clear communication also.

Also, talk to Emily Carson about the information on the disk to make sure it pertained to the project they were working on.thanks,Jamie","I replied to most of the challenges in the order received. Some of them I tried to incorporate multiple problems into a single email when possible.I think most of the problems facing final assembly there could be broken down into 2 groups basically. The first being personnel problems and the second quality.The personnel issues are a problem due to the lack of repsect some had for their fellow coworkers or willingness to work as a team for the bigger goal which would be plant wide success. It seemed there was a lot of pushback to using the SEQUENCE system and really seeing the value in it.The quality category was also a major issue because sending out bad quality products will cause customers to no longer buy your products. It caused a lot of lost time and seems to be really be driving the cost per unit up due to rework. The problems look like they may start costing potential customers. there is no point in having the newest and most innovative product if you cant get it to work.-----Original Message-----From: Assessment Administrator Sent: 4/5/2022 12:31 PM To: Pace, Jamie Cc: Subject : About your day (1 of 2) This e-mail and the one that follows contain some final questions for you.

I did handle them in the order that I received them. However I put more focus and time into the more critical emails. Some situations required a follow up and or direct actions to be taken.2. There are several issues facing Final assembly in the facility. These included lack of a good example at Team Lead. Lack of enthusiasm. Many of the members were not cross-trained. There was not a lot of enthusiasm towards SEQUENCE. Some were on board and some were not.3. This is an issue because of the lack of team work. Most members wanted to work on their own and not take on new people.This also showed a lack of accepting change. Many people fear change and they are not very accepting of it.

NdrGGDUmlRB,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,J.J.I cannot just move a team member because of issues that we don't want to deal with. I will talk to Debbie when I return about her absenteeism and see if there any other issue.,J.J.I have not heard of any rumors concerning the Kirkland plant. I'm sure if there were any changes that Al Howard would inform us.Jamie,NA,"Alex,I will address the group as a whole about conduct when there are guest inside the plant.We will also talk about SEQUNCE and why we are doing it.I will also haveTrim Install do a walk throughto take care of the trash issue.Thanks Jamie Pace: Professional Conduct Hi,You should know that salespeople assigned to our region occasionally use the Bridgeport plant to hold tours for potential customers. Its a good opportunity for the salespeople to show our advanced manufacturing techniques. Unfortunately, we ran into a problem last week when Velma Miller brought in representatives from a major potential account. As she led them past the Trim Install break area, she could overhear two team members making fun of SEQUENCE. They were having a good time making up silly things to be measured against, then taking turns disciplining each other for being very far off their goals. Velma thinks they were Larry Hodges and Harry Vitz.At another point in the tour, one of the guests, who was apparently quite attractive, mentioned to Velma how much she appreciated the opportunity to see our people work as they built the NoiseBreakers. Velma heard someone whistle and one of the team members say, You can watch me work anytime. It was probably Keith Baggus, as hes been known to make similar comments.Velma wasnt sure if any of the customers heard that, but she thought it was highly inappropriate and embarrassing. Id like to think that you will address this immediately. Velma told me that her next tour will be April 26 at 3:00 p.m., and she is very concerned that this issue be addressed by then. Please make sure that your team members understand how important it is to act professionally around customers. And this should also extend to keeping their work areas cleanVelma mentioned that there were some areas around Trim Install that were littered with bits of plastic and empty food wrappers.Thanks.AlexAlex NormanManager, Sales",NA,"Shea,We can do the meeting on April 21 from 7-8am before the shift starts.Also we will need room XR19.Thanks Jamie","Jennifer,I have reviewed the attachment and agree thatwehave an issue.

I handle each challengeas they came to me.

Teamwork- Everyone has to work together even with other teams to produce a good quality product. Team Member Conduct- If team member attitude is bad or they call in everyone else starts acting the same.-----Original Message-----From: Assessment Administrator Sent: 4/5/2022 3:25 PM To: Pace, Jamie Cc: Subject : About your day (1 of 2) This e-mail and the one that follows contain some final questions for you.

It seems as though areas of the assembly line are working against each other. With SEQUENCE, smart changes are being made without any consideration for other areas. Also, team members are being trained in SEQUENCE but then not allowed to put those practices to use.-----Original Message-----From: Assessment Administrator Sent: 4/5/2022 3:25 PM To: Pace, Jamie Cc: Subject : About your day (1 of 2) This e-mail and the one that follows contain some final questions for you.

I think that your team is losing focus. I reviewed Line 1s Trim Install repairs for March and found that your team had several days with excessive repairs. Im sure youre aware how time-consuming repairs can negatively impact our SEQUENCE results.I am attaching some information that you might find helpful. I have combined my teams summary of Marchs Trim Install Repairs for Group A along with an Absence Report that Karen Duvalier provided. Its not unusual for one or two people to be sick or absent on any given day. We find substitutions and carry on with production; however, its clear to me that when Larry isnt on the line, errors go up. Overall, your team really struggled with repairs in March.

Thanks,JenniferJennifer LakeManager, Quality ProcessesAttachment, Hey, JenniferLets set up a class for all the team members and team leader from Trim to go over the SEQUENCE process and importantance.Sent: 4/the 5/2022 5:15 PM To: Pace, Jamie Cc: Subject : Team Focus Hi Jamie,I wanted to draw your attention to a troubling trend that Im seeing. I think that your team is losing focus. I reviewed Line 1s Trim Install repairs for March and found that your team had several days with excessive repairs. Im sure youre aware how time-consuming repairs can negatively impact our SEQUENCE results.I am attaching some information that you might find helpful. I have combined my teams summary of Marchs Trim Install Repairs for Group A along with an Absence Report that Karen Duvalier provided. Its not unusual for one or two people to be sick or absent on any given day. We find substitutions and carry on with production; however, its clear to me that when Larry isnt on the line, errors go up. Overall, your team really struggled with repairs in March. I suppose Paul was more interested in preparing for his new assignment than he was about overseeing the teams activities. Please review the attached information. If there is any way for me to assist in reducing repair rates for April, please let me know. Thanks,JenniferJennifer LakeManager, Quality ProcessesAttachment",NA,"Hey JJ,Thanks for looking into this matter sounds likehelpful thinking.butlets not move forward till we can talk about this so more. we are goon need buy off from quality before be move forward.---Or ige-----From: Paxton, J.J. Sent: 4/5/2022 5:21 PM To: Pace, Jamie Cc: Subject : Turntable Proposal Hi Jamie,We are pretty close to the end of the SmartChanges process and were confident that we have found a way to speed up trim installation. The main change is to attach the frame of a NoiseBreaker to a kind of turntable which would rotate around as the team members installed the various pieces of trim. We think that it will save the team members a lot of walking around during the installation process. We hoped to include Carson Spilkes, but he was too busy. So, the main people working on it were me, Paul Bern, and Emily Carson. We produced a draft design that should be simple to manufacture.I led the research by pulling a lot of data and working on it at home to make sure that our calculations were correct. I take a statistics class in the evenings and I thought that my classmates might also be able to add some insight. My professor and fellow students helped me to look more closely at some recent SEQUENCE data and how our current process has affected efficiency. We all concluded there was room for improvement. Anyway, I know that Paul found a supplier that can manufacture the turntable and he also found some money in the budget to get the unit built and installed. Pauls research indicates that the turntable will take two months to build and ship, and another week to install.I know youre busy today, so Ill plan on calling Barrett Remini today to place our order with the supplier. If you want any details, set up an appointment with me for when you return and we can go over it.Thanks!-J.J.J.J. PaxtonLead, Trim Install, Hey after reviewing this I decided to set up meeting with you on april 22 at 8:00 am to go over this please carry on with the plan.","hey team leadersplease support Issac and contact Cory Manning with any issues. , Hey Issac,Look forward to meeting to you also. thanks for your support I will be in contact.

I will be your contact in the Information Technology department. Anything to do with the programming of production machinery is handled exclusively by my team. Please let me know of any programming needs you have and I will do my best to satisfy them. I have been talking with Al Howard about our new robot programming software. It should help make adjusting the robots and switching between programs much faster than before. Further, your team members will be able to make some adjustments to the robots directly, without involving Engineering or Maintenance. This will save both time and money, and has been approved by both Engineering and Maintenance. It is definitely very different from the current software in place. Al agreed that your group will be the test site for the entire company as we try to get the software finalized. Here is the rollout plan I propose. Please note these dates.Friday April 15: Install the software. We will need a full day to install and configure the software. The installation is automated, and will be done over the networkno one will need to go to your plant. However, we will need to take the current system down while we do this. We will remove your existing software at this time as well, since we are replacing it.April 18-22: Your staff will use the software and report any issues to you. You will send the reports to me and I will act on them. April 25-29: We will make changes to the software to correct problems found by your team.May 2: We will officially roll out the new software for your team to use.Week of May 2-6: We will train your team on using the software now that it is complete. I talked this over with your team leaders and they had no concerns, but they asked that I take it up with you to confirm that we may go forward with this plan. Note that we are very flexible, so please get back to me by the end of the day with any changes you propose to make to this plan or schedule. However, Al wants to get moving within a week.IsaacIsaac TecniovManager, Information Technology",NA,NA,NA,"hey thought you would want to know.,  wanted to make sure you know about this.","1.

Your answers to these questions will help in the evaluation of your performance by providing a better understanding of your approach and rationale. It is important that you provide complete and thorough answers to the questions below.For your reference, a list of messages you received today is shown after question 4.1. Please list the major categories of issues or problems facing Customer Service Team 5 of Soundproof Solutions. Why is each an issue or a problem?*Listening - the Customer Service Team rep on some occasions did not listen to the customer to get a clear understanding of the complaints voiced*Communicating - in some instances the customer was left with no understanding of what the plan would be to address his/her concerns.There waseither notenough information communicated to the customer or no information or instructions at all.*Consistency- reps were providing different solutions to the customers, which was not consistent as far as the customer was concerned, which left him/her more confused than before the call was made.2. What were the three most important messages you considered the highest priorities to handle? Why?QuietPAPER One falling off due to the air temperature changes. Also Hilltop Hotel is luxury hotel, and their clientele could be non-existent based on the appearance of their rooms. Therefore, this would impact any future contracts with Soundproof Solutions.Fletcher Systems is a major customer not only locally, but across the country. Due to the mistakes made by our company, it is imperative that these issues be corrected immediately. the financial impact could be devastating to the company.Eluto Caplanu, due to impact that it had on him/her and their cultural beliefs. Feeling like you are being discriminated against based on your religious beliefs or any other reason is unacceptable. Whether it was meant as a joke or not, this type of behavior is unacceptable.3. List specific examples (if any) of instances where you detected a relationship between two of the messages you received in your inbox. For example, when you decided how respond to one message, did you consider information provided not only in that message, but in other message(s)?The message regarding Eluto Caplanu and the one regarding Professional Conduct made me want to respond in the same way because each instance obviously had to do with one or the others nationality. Making fun of an internal or externalcustomer based on their accent or what meals they choose to eat is unprofessional.4. Describe what additional information you would have liked to have in order to have a better or clearer understanding of the messages and challenges presented to you today.As for myself, when I received emails from my Director, I was unsure as to if any of that could be delegated to one of my direct reports or not. Just because it came from Haley was I obligated to answer it or could Taylor Slade or Kim Persico have resolved the issue?"

I will be your contact in the Information Technology department. Anything to do with the programming of production machinery is handled exclusively by my team. Please let me know of any programming needs you have and I will do my best to satisfy them. I have been talking with Al Howard about our new robot programming software. It should help make adjusting the robots and switching between programs much faster than before. Further, your team members will be able to make some adjustments to the robots directly, without involving Engineering or Maintenance. This will save both time and money, and has been approved by both Engineering and Maintenance. It is definitely very different from the current software in place. Al agreed that your group will be the test site for the entire company as we try to get the software finalized. Here is the rollout plan I propose. Please note these dates.Friday April 15: Install the software. We will need a full day to install and configure the software. The installation is automated, and will be done over the networkno one will need to go to your plant. However, we will need to take the current system down while we do this. We will remove your existing software at this time as well, since we are replacing it.April 18-22: Your staff will use the software and report any issues to you. You will send the reports to me and I will act on them. April 25-29: We will make changes to the software to correct problems found by your team.May 2: We will officially roll out the new software for your team to use.Week of May 2-6: We will train your team on using the software now that it is complete. I talked this over with your team leaders and they had no concerns, but they asked that I take it up with you to confirm that we may go forward with this plan. Note that we are very flexible, so please get back to me by the end of the day with any changes you propose to make to this plan or schedule. However, Al wants to get moving within a week.IsaacIsaac TecniovManager, Information Technology",NA,cory please announce pat as our standard performance winner . please informed both employees of their great test results . it would also be good to show each employee their results so they will have a better idea on whatthey can work on in the futurethanksJamie,NA,"vic , I would like you to ask more question and get more details from JJ. ask question such as what the shop floor issues were ? what were his reasons for downloading files on to a disk ?

Work quality (having to repair excessive equipment) 2.Work place on the jobrelationships among team members3. The abilities to implement new procedures 3.  1. Work Quality - There was a period during the month of march where repairs had to be made that cost the company time and money. These mistakes can not continue to happen if timelines and budgets are going to be made 2. Work Place Relationships - Work place moral is easily one of the top problems. Team members have to be able to work together in the work place. Good work place moral leads to increased productivity, better work attendance, and a better overall product. 3. Implementing new procedures - The work place is forever evolving. Getting the team members to understand that change is good is a very hard thing to do sometimes.

KSdnICMJIeM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"JJ,I got some rework data vs absenteeism for the department. I do see that the days Debby is out we have higher rework numbers, but I also see that there are days when you are covering for other employees who are out that there also high rework numbers. I am not blaming you, just letting you know that there is an observable trend. If this has had anything to do with being distracted by your side project or anything of that matter feel free to discuss it with me in our meeting on the 25th at 9.Thank you,Jamie,","JJ,Unfortunately we cannot hand pick the people we chose for our team that comes from HR. However a large portion of the SEQUENCE process is to make sure that all employees know how to do all aspects of the process. Even if it might take a while longer to train some of these new employees we must make sure that we get it taken care of.

No I did not handle each challenge in the order received. I prioritized the responses by who sent them and the nature of each issue. I looked for messages from my boss first off and then others from the management chain first and the severity of the issue second. 2. The major issues facing final assembly at Bridgeport are absenteeism and the quality issues that are caused by people having to cover other jobs. Another issue is that there are still some employees who are not behind the SEQUENCE system and this is causing both personal and workmanship issues.3. The issue of absenteeism is a problem because it causes the area leads to have to cover one specific persons job instead of being able to support the entire area. When the lead cant keep an eye on others in the area the chance for them to have problems increases. Notfollowing with SEQUENCE is an issue because it is the model for running the production line. Part of the issue in quality could stem from the face that the works on the floor aren't following sequence and not adhering to the changes and updates to the process and while you have some team members doing things the new way you still have others doing it the old way causing quality issues.-----Original Message-----From: Assessment Administrator Sent: 4/5/2022 12:31 PM To: Pace, Jamie Cc: Subject : About your day (1 of 2) This e-mail and the one that follows contain some final questions for you.

I got hung up on the costumer complaint question and I left part of that for last. In a real situation some things were a little more important that really didn't need my decision like the victory party. 2. There were some problems in the quality of the work. I know Larry had trouble and didn't want to adapt to the new ways and that really did affect his work. I feel the workers weren't doing a good job at checking their work and the persons previous work to spot errors. that would save on a bad product at the end. I did my best trying to address all of it.3. Like I said, Larry was the 'old timer' that didn't want to change from the old ways. And the others I feel like some people were getting bored with their position and not really paying attention like they would be if trying something new. Also, there were a lot of projects and little changes happening all at once that probably didn't help either.Original Message-----From: Assessment Administrator Sent: 4/5/2022 12:31 PM To: Pace, Jamie Cc: Subject : About your day (1 of 2) This e-mail and the one that follows contain some final questions for you.

He does not seem to be a team player and has been deficient in his work and his team has suffered because of it. T3. J.J. has fostered a hostile work environment that spread throughout the line. Including the lack of support for SEQUENCE by Larry and Harry. The sexual harassment by Keithmustbeaddressed immediately and cannot continue. Keith was not on his team but could have impacted the entire line. The inter action between Emily and Larry further showcases this point of creating a hostile work environment and can be seen affecting the productivity of the entire line.

The three most important emails would be:1. Theft of company property.2. Professional Conduct.3. The interaction between Larry and EmilyLeast important:1. Kirkland Plant employees.2. Victory Lunch.3. Suggestion Box.The important emails impacted significant breach of company policy. Involving theft and sexual harassment. These items need to be addressed immediately and must be followed up on in a timely manner.THe policies based around the company values are the most important building block. Quality and safety are important and must be addressed. Innovation was addressed with the suggestion box and is important but not a significant priority for the day. Mutual respect is important to the three important emails I chose as they directly refect upon someones well-being. The interactions with theft must be made in a way that ensures company policy and procedures are followed. including innocent until proven guilty. An investigation must be conducted while maintaining respect for the employee. Someone facing sexual harassment may not feel the need to speak up, however when advances are not questioned the harassment may become worse in this case it could have also lost business for the company. Customer service is another priority that must be addressed in a timely fashion as customers want a quick resolution to the product they paid for. I worked to ensure that those involved in a project or meeting were informed. I wanted to keep my team informed of all aspects that could affect them.

Sent: 4/5/2022 7:50 AM To: Manning, Cory Cc: Subject : Turntable Proposal Hi Cory,We are pretty close to the end of the SmartChanges process and were confident that we have found a way to speed up trim installation. The main change is to attach the frame of a NoiseBreaker to a kind of turntable which would rotate around as the team members installed the various pieces of trim. We think that it will save the team members a lot of walking around during the installation process. We hoped to include Carson Spilkes, but he was too busy. So, the main people working on it were me, Paul Bern, and Emily Carson. We produced a draft design that should be simple to manufacture.I led the research by pulling a lot of data and working on it at home to make sure that our calculations were correct. I take a statistics class in the evenings and I thought that my classmates might also be able to add some insight. My professor and fellow students helped me to look more closely at some recent SEQUENCE data and how our current process has affected efficiency. We all concluded there was room for improvement. Anyway, I know that Paul found a supplier that can manufacture the turntable and he also found some money in the budget to get the unit built and installed. Pauls research indicates that the turntable will take two months to build and ship, and another week to install.I know youre busy today, so Ill plan on calling Barrett Remini today to place our order with the supplier. If you want any details, set up an appointment with me for when you return and we can go over it.Thanks!J.J.J.J. PaxtonLead, Trim Install,","hi Isaac,Please proceed as plan.

Contact Karen and see what she has to say about this important issue.","Hello, when responding to the emails I attached them as they came down the list. I felt it was a better strategy to handle them as the come rather than pick and choose which are more important at the time. All emails in this situation were important because all the work needed to be handled before I left for vacation. In regards to issues facing the facility. The most important are the workers feel unappreciated, we have a major inspection coming up and proper maintenance practices are not being executed, and inappropriate behavior is being exhibited in the work center towards others and the company itself. They are major issues because the workers feel unappreciated/used so therefore they don't produce a good product because they feel the company doesn't care about them so why should they care about the company. Offering to buy someone lunch isn't going to be the factor that turns people around.-----Original Message-----From: Assessment Administrator Sent: 4/5/2022 12:31 PM To: Pace, Jamie Cc: Subject : About your day (1 of 2) This e-mail and the one that follows contain some final questions for you.

Hello,I felt the three most important emails were concerning company theft, corporate audit, and professional conduct. The three least important were concerning SEQUENCE talk, earlier interaction, and victory lunch. The critical emails were important because stealing of company information is a huge deal that needs to be handled immediately. The corporate audit is important because it shows how we are actually producing these products and how we produce them. Lastly, the profession conduct is important because it shows the character of our company. That needed to be handled because people need to feel comfortable in the work center at all times. In regards to the information being shared due to messaging. I felt all the information helped me better understand what was going on and where the correction/input needed to be routed.-----Original Message-----From: Assessment Administrator Sent: 4/5/2022 12:30 PM To: Pace, Jamie Cc: Subject : About your day (2 of 2) Following are some of the e-mails that you received today, along with some questions about how you approached them.

This obviously shines a bad light on all of us here at Bridgeport and especially Group A, line 1. I need each of you to personally talk to these employees to see if they did in fact say these things.

After lunch Ibegan to do them in an order that I felt most pressing based on the message subject and content. I thenwent back to the order of oldest firstto finish the remaining emails.Q2: I think lack of communication by the company to the employee about why they are implementing this SEQUENCE change.Lack of supervisor training for new leaders can lead to poor leadership. These new leaders don't know what they don't know so they may have some missteps in the beginning that can either hurt moral or set them back.

adcalyAsqvZ,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Cory, today as we were walking through the plant I overheard a conversation that I feel you need to be aware of. The conversation was between Emily and Larry from the trim shop. over SEQUENCE. I know Larry has been here 20 years and is very knowledgeable of the process but it appeared to me that his attitude may be getting in his way. He wasdisrespectful to Emily talkingabout how SEQUENCE works and the time saved by it. I sounded likehe feels the old way works so why do we need to change it. I was just making sure you were aware of the issues. Iam not just throwing this in your lap just I wanted to go through the right chain of command. If you have any question about what I overheard feel free to call or emailThanks",NA,"J.J., I am unaware of any issue with Debby since I am new to this job. But from reading your email I think that this needs to be moved on to HR. If shelate for work all the time and her personal problems effect her work production and the teams production.After reading your Doxy I wonderingif the problem they hadcouldfrom one of her problems. In your investigation ofthe Doxy problem check and see if she was here or off sick that day please. I am going to forward this on to HR so that they are aware of the issue we are having. thanks for the head up on the issue our team is having.",I am sorry but you will not be able to hand pick who the team gets. I feel it is unfair to say that the people that are transferring to our plant are going to be behind and to hard to train. I ask that we as a team keep an open mind about the people that we will be getting and put yourself in their shoes. How would you feel to be transferred to a new plant that you did not know anyone. So keep open mind and we will train them to do the job and to do it right.,NA,Thanks for the information and the issues that you mention will be addressed. I will be on vacation for the next 2 weeks and will have a team meeting onApril 21stto address the issues. But I am also forwarding this on to the area leads so theycan alsoaddress this before the team meeting. Since we do not have any names for certain will have to address this as a subject and call out any one person. Thanks again for the heads up on the issue and again it will be addressed not just because of the customer but creating a better work environment.,NA,Shae April 21st works great for me so setup BP07 at 5-6 for our meeting please. Food always makes the works feel appreciated when it comes to meeting. Also thanks for the information Final Assembly team attitude on SEQUENCE. I hope that the meeting and have Al Howard there will help change the team members attitude and approach using SEQUENCE.Thanks,"Jennifer, thanks for the information about Group A. I agree that Larry is an important member of our team but I see other issues. I do agree that there appears to be excessive absences in March for Group A. Can you give methe last three months attendance reports so I can see if there is a pattern. Also I noticed on the report that the issue may not be Larry not being on the line but with JJ Paxton filing in. The days that he substituted was the days that we had the most repairs. As you are aware I leaving for two week vacation and will not be able to address the issue I see till I get back. However I will talk to JJ and see what the issue is since he is the lead on the trim install team and the repairs increase when he fills in. Thanks again for calling this to my attention.",NA,"J.J., Thanks for the update on the research that you and your group has done on this project. I do have a few question on this the first one is have we check with any other manufactures about building the turntable. I think it would be a good idea to have multi bids on this to see what the best option would be. The second question is about your class and the feedback your class had about improving the process by usingSEQUENCE.So with these question I would like toput a hold on the order until we have time to talk. I return on April 22 so I would like to have a meeting on April,23 at 9:00 if that works for you.ThanksJamie",Isaac I do have a few questions. The firstis that our current software will be removed and replaced with the new programon April 15th. Is this going to be done after production hours or are we going to lose the whole day of production? Also we have to use the program to help to work out any bugs that we come across but we are not trained on the program until after we use it and the bugs are worked out. I see a big problem with this cause we could lose a lot of production and our repairs will goover the trial period if we have to train ourselves on the new program. I feel the schedule needs to be redone and come up with a schedule that will not effect production and repairs and works for both my team and yours. I am sure that you are unaware that I will be on vacation for the next two weeks and if there is an issues with creating a new schedule get with me by the end of the day and I assign someone to this. Thanks and look forward to working with you on this in the future.,NA,"Cory, I think this is a good idea to help motivate our employees. But after looking over the question and the scores I feel different about the winner then Paul does. The way that I was looking at the question I feel that they were given positive points for negative actions. An example of this is on question 4 making decisions without others input. Pat had a higher score which makes his average higher but I feel that is a negative action. I feel yes you should make decision but sometime you need other input. The other question that I have a problem with the score is 11. There again I feel they are giving a higher score for a negative action of over steeping his authority. So after reading over the questions Ifeel that JJ is the winner.So they date of the of the lunch is when I am on vacation. I would like to be here when we announce the vacation so if we an move the date to April 22nd that would be great. I will be going on vacation starting at the end of the day so if this date does not work please get back with me by the end of the day.",NA,Thanks Vic for your information on this subject. But I feel that is information needs to go thru HR before you escort out of the plant. I do agree that we have a serious issue that need addressed but I also feel that it needs to be done the correct way. So I feel that you need to talk to HR and inform them about what you saw and how you came about this information. This is very series I just feel that we need to have all of our ducks in a row before we approach JJ again. So talk to HR and I will forward this email and my response to them. I will be on vacation for the next 2 weeks starting at the end of the day. I will return to work on April 20th.Thanks,"Original Message-----From: Assessment Administrator Sent: 4/5/2022 2:20 PM To: Pace, Jamie Cc: Subject : About your day (1 of 2) This e-mail and the one that follows contain some final questions for you.

Shouldn't this be done prior to the switch? Talk with team leads for their input before proceeding.The issues that come up the week of the 18th should be brought to Jennifer Lake, Harley Price so they can advise you.

If I couldn'ttell if it was important or not then I would take care of it if it didn't take up too much time. For the emails that I knew wouldtake up a lot of time, I read it and let it sit in my head, then completed it when I was able to plan. 2. It was basically broken down to: Operations, Administrative, and Human Resources. The Operations issue is that their are errors in the fabric installation and our customer Doxy is not happy. Administrative issues are that there is a new Turntable proposal but I will not be able to review proposal since I will be out on vacation.TheHuman Resources needs are that there are employees who may not be working well with other employees or projects that are being implements, this is a result of miscommunication and lack or transparency between employees, such as Email and Larry and professional conduct. 3. The operations issue is an issue because it directly impacts our customer and warranty which effects the bottom line of the company, if we lose their sales then we may need to downgrade our team. The administrative issue because it will make a lot of changes to the company and if we do not make the right choice then it can be very costly to the organization. The Human Resources issue because that has an impact on entire culture of the organization and will take the company downhill if not addressed early and properly.-----Original Message-----From: Assessment Administrator Sent: 4/5/2022 11:31 AM To: Pace, Jamie Cc: Subject : About your day (1 of 2) This e-mail and the one that follows contain some final questions for you.

Let's check with Carson to make sure someone on his team, as well as HES, have vetted the idea - I want to make sure all stakeholders are aware so that we don't have any surprises during installation.Feel free to set up some time to discuss this later this afternoon, and let's hold off on placing the order until we hear back from Carson. Even if he doesn't have time for a meeting, maybe we can squeeze in a quick call to get his buy-in.Thanks again - this is exactly the type of solution that will make the SEQUENCE process successful at Bridgeport.Jackie","Hi Isaac-I'm looking forward to working with you as well. I'm concerned about rolling out the software prior to providing training to employees - I don't want anyone caught off-guard. Would it be possible to revise the schedule to provide training on April 15 and install the software the following week?

JJ has previously informed me that he's been working on troubleshooting some issues on his own time, and working with statistics classmates on improving plant performance. Please refrain from initiating the termination paperwork until I can discuss the issue with JJ to obtain additional information. I'd like to discuss the information that he's been saving to removable disks and confirm that he's in alignment with the company security policy.

Your answers to these questions will help in the evaluation of your performance by providing a better understanding of your approach and rationale. It is important that you provide complete and thorough answers to the questions below.For your reference, a list of messages you received today is shown after question 4.1. Please list the major categories of issues or problems facing Customer Service Team 5 of Soundproof Solutions. Why is each an issue or a problem? Some of the major issues we had today was talking to the customer in a professional manner. It seems like for example the Hospitalcould have been taken care of with one phone call. However, the reps didn't handle the calls property which escalatedto me the supervisor taking the call. Also, they have issues with talking about our clients behind their backs and picking on other coworkers. This to me sounds like they need a refresher in human resources.2. What were the three most important messages you considered the highest priorities to handle? Why? Hospital, Installers Calendar, HR issues. Hospital because it was not done properly from installation to the phone calls. This should not have taken over a month to get resolved. Installers calendar they are a main point of contact with our clients since they see them day in and day out. It's important that if they have issues that Cyd will come to the task force meeting and give us feedback. We need to make sure not to overbook and schedule enough people to do the job. HR issues with making fun of a coworker. It is inexcusable for people to downgrade anyone in the workplace. A workplace should not be a hostile environment.3. List specific examples (if any) of instances where you detected a relationship between two of the messages you received in your inbox. For example, when you decided how respond to one message, did you consider information provided not only in that message, but in other message(s)? When I got emails for promotion for a part-time rep and to help move level 1 employees to level 2. I leaned on some files from Barney as well as productivity results from Haley. I like getting everyone's feedback before making a rash decision on the first day of the job.4. Describe what additional information you would have liked to have in order to have a better or clearer understanding of the messages and challenges presented to you today.The messages you received today included:Weedler Contracting: A customer is suspected of abusing the companys replacement policiesEluto Caplanu: Someone has placed an insulting message on Elutos lunchEffective mentoring pays dividends: Taylor mentored Jerry Winters and presents the results - where is everyone else's results. I wouldn't let a level 2 rep go ahead and do a coordinator's job but would have liked to see if anyone else was succeeding and go from there.Customer satisfaction insights: Tracy Hurdle reports research on customer satisfactionPromotion: There is new room in the budget to promote a part-time employee to full-timeProfessional conduct: A salesperson complains that representatives behave unprofessionallyTheft of company-confidential information: A security guard suspects an associate of improper activityBench strength: Representatives must be signed up for training per company policy - give more than 3 people an opportunityto train.quietPAPER ONE: A new product is faulty and will start to produce complaints in two weeks- a list of companies that use that particular product. Just so we can have an idea on how many might call in about a faulty product.Paperless office: A plan is presented to replace paper files - is it that important that it needs to be done right away or could it wait until I got back from vacation.Installation in Sales: Sales requests scheduling soundproofing for their area, and a meeting with a customer- I would have liked to make my own calendar where I can move the installationsaround myself. It's easier than it being on a document that I can't do myself.Feedback process: Kim proposes a way to efficiently deal with customer feedbackFletcher Systems: An unhappy customer demands reinstallation and a meeting"

This behavior is unacceptable and will address it immediately. I willmeet with both of them and reiterate the importance of acting professional at all times. Again, thank you for letting me know.Cary StevensLeader, Customer SupportSoundproof Solutions,","Haley,I have decided that Ashley is the best candidate. While she did not score as high on performance index, which I believe is subjective, she is a hard worker with a great understanding of processes. It seems as though Blaine requires more supervision to stay on task. I think Eden is very productive, but sometimes getting more done, is not necessarily the best. You have to weigh quantity and quality. I think Ashley has a great balance of both.I look forward to giving her the good news.Thank you,Cary,",NA,NA,"Hello Haley,Please see below my choices for candidacy:Jess Rollins - One of his areas of development is to broaden him. He needs all three courses. I think he make a great candidate because he is ready to move up and has shown interest. I believe giving him this opportunity will boost his morale. Tracy Hurdle - Tracy is great at taking initiative and will be up for a challenge. She is a very hard worker and likes taking on extra projects. Sandy Martin - She is efficient and great on the computer. Please let me know if you do not agree with the recommendations as you know the team better than I do.Thank you,Cary,",NA,NA,"Taylor,Thank you for making me aware of the issue. I think it will be a good idea for the team to complete a module on workplace bullying and what constitutes bullying. I will send an email out to the team, letting them know that the module will be coming to their inbox.Thank you,Cary,",NA,"Haley,Please see below an issue we are having with one of our regular commercial customers. I am going to ask Cheryl to set up a meeting, upon my return from vacation, to discuss some possible changes to our replacement policy to ensure we are providing our customers with the best service while maintaining the costs of the company. Thank you,Cary, Taylor,Thank you for bringing this issue to my attention. Based on what you are telling me, I too have my suspicions of Mr. Weedler finding a way around to get free product. Unfortunately, our policy states that a single replacement is sent out immediately without requiring replacement. We cannot change the policy for one customer only. I will work with Haley in coming up with a solutionto possibly a change in our Customer Support Policies. Perhaps we will be able to put a cap on how many times a commercial customer can have a single replacement without sending back the defective product in a specified time frame. I will set up a meeting with Haley upon my return. I am open to any suggestions you can provide prior to our meeting. Feel free to email them to me and I can look over them prior toour meeting. Thank you,Cary StevensLeader, Customer SupportSoundproof Solutions","Liang,Tracy has notified me of her using the data for a school project. She is researching to see if there is any correlating data between call time and customer satisfaction. I will advise her to complete the project during her breaks and lunches and not to download data to a disk. I believe with enough data, we can make changes to the way we handle scheduling calls for a better customer experience. Thank you for making me aware of the situation!Cary StevensLeader, Customer SupportSoundproof Solutions,","-----Original Message-----From: Assessment Administrator Sent: 4/5/2022 1:25 PM To: Stevens, Cary Cc: Subject : RESPONSE REQUIRED: About your day This e-mail contains some final questions for you. Your answers to these questions will help in the evaluation of your performance by providing a better understanding of your approach and rationale. It is important that you provide complete and thorough answers to the questions below.For your reference, a list of messages you received today is shown after question 4.1. Please list the major categories of issues or problems facing Customer Service Team 5 of Soundproof Solutions. Why is each an issue or a problem?Customer complaints--multiple representatives spoke witha customer and none of them were able to resolve her issues. Policy updates-The policies as it relates to replacement for commercial customers should be evaluated. In the case of Weedler, he is clearly working the system for gain.Training-some reps had none of the training classes, is it because they weren't given the opportunity or because they didn't want to complete them.2. What were the three most important messages you considered the highest priorities to handle? Why?I was methodical and answered the emails as they came in, in the order in which they were received. They were all important. If I had to put importance on any of them, it would be the ""Problem with your Paint"" because the customer had spoken to multiple reps with no resolution. The second would be QuietPAPER ONE because thecustomers should be notified immediately of a defective product. It is better for them to find out before they start seeing the product as defective.Third, I would say professional conduct. You don't want potential customers hearing employees talk about other customers. It really creates a negative outlook on the company.3. List specific examples (if any) of instances where you detected a relationship between two of the messages you received in your inbox. For example, when you decided how respond to one message, did you consider information provided not only in that message, but in other message(s)?I did not think of Tracy's project being a breach. The information she was using, I did not feel as though it was confidential, but when I read the email from the security guard, I realized she actually downloaded company files on a disk. When I responded to calendar change requests, I had to remember how I moved the calendar around before in order to make changes again. 4. Describe what additional information you would have liked to have in order to have a better or clearer understanding of the messages and challenges presented to you today.I would have liked to have the cost of the paint for the call with Kendall Wilson. Also, performance appraisals for the employees. The messages you received today included:Weedler Contracting: A customer is suspected of abusing the companys replacement policiesEluto Caplanu: Someone has placed an insulting message on Elutos lunchEffective mentoring pays dividends: Taylor mentored Jerry Winters and presents the resultsCustomer satisfaction insights: Tracy Hurdle reports research on customer satisfactionPromotion: There is new room in the budget to promote a part-time employee to full-timeProfessional conduct: A salesperson complains that representatives behave unprofessionallyTheft of company-confidential information: A security guard suspects an associate of improper activityBench strength: Representatives must be signed up for training per company policyquietPAPER ONE: A new product is faulty and will start to produce complaints in two weeksPaperless office: A plan is presented to replace paper filesInstallation in Sales: Sales requests scheduling soundproofing for their area, and a meeting with a customerFeedback process: Kim proposes a way to efficiently deal with customer feedbackFletcher Systems: An unhappy customer demands reinstallation and a meeting"

Did you handle each challenge in the order you received it, or did you handle them another way? Please describe your approach.No. Typically, I am going to respond to challenges based on their level of urgency. For example, an employee on the brink of termination rises high on the urgency list. Also, I tend to place a greater sense of urgency on responding to my boss. I place a high urgency on meeting mycommitments. For example, those items that were prescheduled were handled as scheduled due in part to other people being dependent on our mutual commitment to meet. In reality, I would juggle my schedule as needed to ensure I addressed critical issues in a timely fashion.2. Please list the major categories of issues or problems facing Final Assembly in the Bridgeport facility of Soundproof Solutions.Personnel/TeamworkLack ofEmployee EngagementQuality issuesWork Efficiency and EffectivenessCoaching UpwardRecognition and it's appropriate applicationProtecting proprietary information3. Describe why each entry in Question 2 is an issue or problem.Personnel/Teamwork - people and their successful collaboration and cooperation are the critical factors to successfully run a business. When people are not working well together, efficiency and productivity suffer. People and their personalities throw a tremendous number of variables into the challenge of running a business..Lack of Employee Engagement - When people aren't engaged, it isdifficult to make progress on any initiative.Quality issues - Maintaining high quality is essential to maintaining high customer satisfaction. High customer satisfaction is required to maintain and grow a business.Work Efficiency and Effectiveness - Maintaining a high level of efficiency and effectiveness is critical to staying competitive in the market place.Coaching Upward - There are times when our management doesn't completely understand a situation, and this sometimes results in their making incorrect assumptions and/ordrawing incorrect conclusions. Consequently, upward communication and sometimes coaching can be of value.Recognition - We need to be sure the recognition we give supports what we're trying to achieve by sending the right message.Protecting proprietary information - although usually well intentioned, people need to understand the boundaries around proprietary information and their responsibility to protect it.

Why did you feel that the e-mails you rated as most important were critical?The Theft e-mail involved potentially terminating someone and threatening their livelihood. The consequences could have had a lasting impact. Consequently, I scheduled a meeting with both parties involved.The Warranty Claim e-mail highlighted a quality concern that posed an immediate threat tothe business.The Professional Conduct e-mail illustrated unacceptable behavior that cannot be tolerated in the workplace, a lack of buy-in by employees to a significant improvement initiative, and had potential to give customers a poor impression and thus threaten the business.3.Todays assessment provided you with background information about Soundproof Solutions and also presented thechallenging messages listed above.

lExxQGHvHMY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Tracy,I think that it is a good thing that you are excited about our area and looking for things to help improve processes here.However I am concerned about you sharing our information from the company in your class. I am going to have to ask that you not continue to share our information outside the company. Furthermore, while I think our customers are looking for a quick resolution to their issues, I don't believe we should automatically push every time for the fastest resolution. We should be focused on solving the customers issues without rushing through the process. Our customers expect the best service from us and pushing for quick call resolution is not always the best option.Please do notpass this process on to the other members as we do not want to set a precedent that goes against what upper management has identified as approved training processes.thank you,Cary, Haley,please review the information below. I think that Tracy was trying to do the right thing and work on a process to benefit the company, however I am concerned with what she might have shared with outside sources. Please let me know how to proceed with this. I do not know the extent of what she has shared, only that she is in a class and has passed on some statistics. It might be nothing that opens us up to an issue but I would rather be safe than sorry.Thank You,Cary",NA,NA,"Taylor,I reviewed your data and I don't want Jerry to replace you while you are on vacation.

Iam glad we caught this before it continued tohappen.While it is our policy to replace one roll at no cost for a commercial customer without replacement, I do believe 8rolls is quiet excessive.If I was using a company that had provided 8 bad items out of 9 orders I would question the use of that company in the future, yet he continues to use our products.We will let him place another order and notify him thatin the future we will not replace items for him without returning the defective items.Advise him that no other customers are reporting this many issues andifhe is having this many problems we would like to see the rolls tocheck our quality control.This willserve2 purposes.If there really is a problem, we will be able to verify it.If there is not a problem, he will realize that we have figured him out andstop requesting free rolls.Thank You,Carey,","Liang,thank you for copying me on this.

As you can see in the email below, someone made inappropriate comments towards Velma Miller. We do not have confirmation that it was Keith Baggus, but I would like to begin there. I have reached out to Robin Moskowitz, the team lead to determine if she has any insight into who may have made the comments. For the purposes of this I would like to involve Keith, Robin and any other potential offenders in a fact finding/coaching session with HR representation.I think it may be good to have a refresher for the team at some point in the near future as well. In regards to the other issues referenced below, I will address with the employees.Thanks,Jamie Pace, Hello Alex,Let me first apologize for any behavior on behalf of my team.

I appreciate the offer for programming help, I'llbe sure to reach out should issues arise.Looking at the schedule, I think it would be beneficial to have training prior to initiating the pilot. It will increase employee buy-in, and should provide you better feedback for improvements. It will also help to reduce production slow downs and errors caused by unfamiliarity to the software. I propose a slight adjustment to the rollout plan:Monday April 11 - April 15: We will train your team on using the software now that it is completeFriday April 15: Install the software. We will need a full day to install and configure the software. The installation is automated, and will be done over the networkno one will need to go to your plant. However, we will need to take the current system down while we do this. We will remove your existing software at this time as well, since we are replacing it.April 18-22: Your staff will use the software and report any issues to you. You will send the reports to me and I will act on them.April 25-29: We will make changes to the software to correct problems found by your team.May 2: We will officially roll out the new software for your team to use.Week of May 2-6: Retraining of employees based on feedback changes.I will be out on vacation beginning tomorrow and returning on 4/20.

Your answers to these questions will help in the evaluation of your performance by providing a better understanding of your approach and rationale. It is important that you provide complete and thorough answers to the questions below.For your reference, a list of messages you received today is shown after question 4.1. Please list the major categories of issues or problems facing Customer Service Team 5 of Soundproof Solutions. Why is each an issue or a problem?Interpersonal communication- there was a lot of speculation as to what others on the team maybe up to. Some of the people have problems with one another that haven't been addressed and are being pushed off on the leader to deal with. Communication with other departments- Lack of communication that was between customer service representatives and installers was bug as installers are the face of the company, but customer service representatives handle problems and complaints.Motivation- After speaking with Jess, I could see how it would be straining to deal with mostly negative situations when taking customer calls about complaints and problems. I would definitely try to keep morale up on the team2. What were the three most important messages you considered the highest priorities to handle? Why?1. Problem with Paint call with Kendall- Customer Satisfaction and Quality is key2. Eluto Caplanu- At the very basis of it, if the workplace is not acohesive and accepting environment, the work that needs to be done will either not get done or will be sub par. Team members need to feel like they belong and like what they are doing matters so be productive3. Weedler Contracting- Taylor needed to be talked off the ledge in his want to intervene to have the customer not be able to place another order. He needed to be reminded to keep the grand scheme in mind, to not lose business for the company, and to know that there was a way to handle the situation moving forward by not letting them get by with the way things were going.3. List specific examples (if any) of instances where you detected a relationship between two of the messages you received in your inbox. For example, when you decided how respond to one message, did you consider information provided not only in that message, but in other message(s)?For a while I didn't think that I would be needing to respond to Taylor's message about the installation calendar when in reality I had to make two changes.I had to send Cheryl several message on adding to making changes to calendar for meetings after she sent out the first calendar of meetings that had already been scheduled.On Haley's message about promotion, I was able to look back at quarterly performance reports for team members to determine who I thought was best for the promotion4. Describe what additional information you would have liked to have in order to have a better or clearer understanding of the messages and challenges presented to you today.I felt like the information that I needed to get the tasks and calls done was there. There were no glaring holes for me. If I had specific questions for the callers, I just asked then to try to get a little more detail. Otherwise, I found the information to be sufficient.The messages you received today included:Weedler Contracting: A customer is suspected of abusing the companys replacement policiesEluto Caplanu: Someone has placed an insulting message on Elutos lunchEffective mentoring pays dividends: Taylor mentored Jerry Winters and presents the resultsCustomer satisfaction insights: Tracy Hurdle reports research on customer satisfactionPromotion: There is new room in the budget to promote a part-time employee to full-timeProfessional conduct: A salesperson complains that representatives behave unprofessionallyTheft of company-confidential information: A security guard suspects an associate of improper activityBench strength: Representatives must be signed up for training per company policyquietPAPER ONE: A new product is faulty and will start to produce complaints in two weeksPaperless office: A plan is presented to replace paper filesInstallation in Sales: Sales requests scheduling soundproofing for their area, and a meeting with a customerFeedback process: Kim proposes a way to efficiently deal with customer feedbackFletcher Systems: An unhappy customer demands reinstallation and a meeting"

ZhNcwHOqOZD,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Tracy, Please forward all findings to, Kim Persico, Level 1 Coordinator. I would like her and I to take a look at these findings before anything is relayed to Haley. I appreciate your eagerness to look at ways to help improve yourteam and calls, but due to Customer Service having many different needs changes will need to be evaluated and monitored before being put into action. Some calls that take longer to handle are the more escalated cases. These cases are usually customers that are having issues and need more time spent on the calls. This is a great start to a possible change and ask that you hold all emails and conversations with Haley at this time regarding this issue. Thank you, Cary , Tracy, I wanted to add to the previous email that I sent to you early today. The Security officer relayed that the information you looked at was downloaded on a disc and removed from our facility. I want to remind you that this information is private and not to be removed from the facility at any time. Please request to get such information in the future from Kim or myself so we can look over what is being used for personal use. Thank you, Cary",NA,NA,"Taylor, I also think that is a great idea. It is always important to motivate our employees and give them the opportunity to better themselves. Please let him know I will be here to help in any way I can. Thanks, Cary , Taylor,After going over theSurvey we might want to look at this at another time. It seems he has some issues with communication, decision making skills, and treating others fairly. I will support whatever decision you have for your team but feel he might not be the best fit for this situation. I will be more than happy to over see your team for those days of vacation. Please let me know what you think about this. Cary",NA,"Haley, I have chosen Ashley Payne to promote from TPT to full time for several reasons. I noticed from past documentation that she is an excellent worker with good scores from the customer service standpoint and the Teamwork assessment. She has a solid understanding of our processes and her productivity score is well above average. Thank you for giving one of our TPT employees the opportunity for full time employment. It has become increasingly busier of the next few weeks and the extra help will only help the department achieve more. Thank you, Cary ,",NA,NA,"Haley, The three level 1 reps I would like to nominate to qualify for advancement to level 2 would be as follows:1. Quinn Labarra: She has completed all 3 courses prior to this time and has been listed as someone who is eager to learn. She has a wonderful customer service rating and an even better rating from her peers. 2. Ashley Payne: She has only completed the CS2BASIC course but has a solid understanding of our processes and described to be an excellent worker. She has a good customer service rating and her team thinks of her in high regards also. She would cost me 2 pts for the two classes she has not yet taken (CS2IM and CS2LSIS).3. Jamie Dubrovich: She currently has completed two classes (CS2BASIC and CS2IM) leaving CS2LSIS left to take. She is thought of in high regards from her peers and good with customers/internal partners. Her customer service score is rated as an A and her team ranked her with aB. I think all of these associates would make great Level 2 reps and have a desire to move forward when the opportunity presents itself. Thank you, Cary ,",NA,NA,"Taylor, Thank you for letting me know and I will address this with a mass email to the team. Please let me know if this behavior continues and we will address each individual from there. Cary,",NA,NA,"Liang, Thank you for letting me know about this issue with Tracy. Tracy was doing a project with her school and has reported that information to me.

roiiSjJJREb,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"I would first speak with Larry regarding his tact when speaking to other co workers. The fact that he sarcastically approached Emily is probably a reason why Emily was defensive. It sounds by the conversation that they have had this talk before and it seems that is becoming a problem. I would let Larry know that she is here for a reason and her work should be respected. I would tell Larry that his advice is invaluable since his history with the company is lengthy but that doesn't mean he should approach any co worker with a negative demeanor. I would explain to Larry that I understand if he is frustrated with a new structure but heneed to remember to be professional at all times. I would encourage him to speak with his supervisor if he feels strongly about any issue.As far as Emily, I would also have a conversation with her. I wouldreiteratethatshe is important to the team and that she is here for a reason. I would let her know that she is doing a good job but to remember not to accuse any co worker of trying to derail the process. She should not assume just because someone doesn't see eye to eye with her that they are trying to derail or make her look bad.

No one should be acting unprofessional whether is their break or not. I need Velma to confirm who for sure the two employees she heard making comments are. I would hate to speak to the wrong employees if they were not responsible for the comments. It is a major issue that we need to address with everyone involved but we must first ask Velma if she know for sure who were the people in the break room and also the identity of the person who made those comments on the floor. If she cannot reach me before the day ends then have her contact Cory Manning. This issue need to be addressed as soon as possible. I will notify Cory to expect to resolve this if I do not get a chance to handle it today. Cory, We need to identify who these people where and make sure we explain to them our policy and remind them that this is a professional place of work. I might not be able to get all the proper information before I leave today so please make sure we can resolve this.

Please schedule 4/21 at 12:00 PM - 1:00 PM in room BP07 ( there's enough chairs and a projector). Please invite the entire Group A Line 1 team including Emily Carson, and let them know lunch is provided.Thanks,Jamie,","J.J.,We need to work with our team to identify issues on Trim Install. I know the issue of absenteeism is one obstacle, I think we need to work on being better prepared to backfill when someone is out.Put together a plan to reduce repair rates and absenteeism by 4/21. One idea is to work with Larry to help the other team members gain more knowledge and skills so that they can deliver these results when he, or other team members, are off work.Thanks,Jamie,",NA,"Hi, J.J.I am excited to hear about the initiative to speed up the trim installation. I appreciate the work that you have completed to research this potential solution, but hold off on calling Barrett Remini. I am certain that we have room for improvement, but I want to get engineering involved and verify that this is the right approach and that we still have money in the budget for this project. We will discuss further after I return on 4/20.Thanks,Jamie,","Hi, Isaac.I look forward to working with you. I will be out of the office after today until 4/20. Cory Manning will be here to support you and our teams through this process.I would encourage you to have a communication plan on what and why this upgrade is happening for our team members.

No, I handled the challenges in the priority that I perceived to be most important at that moment. If a higher priority came in, though, I may still be completing a lesser priority. I dealt with the discipline and conduct as soon as it came up, then prepared for meetings, items from my boss, issues from my team, and items from outside. (In that semi-order.)2. Lack of Communication with each other and other teams. Resistance to change and gaining commitment to change. Trusting each other and management. Buy-in of SEQUENCE and the values of the company.3. Lack of Communication with each other and other teams, because they are not being led to communicate or shown the importance and value of communication.   Resistance to change and gaining commitment to change, because they do not understand why there is a change and how they fit into the resolution or see the value it gives them in their job.   Trusting each other and management, because they fear change and they are looking into the past at previous encounters instead of helping each build new ones. Buy-in of SEQUENCE and the values of the company, because they have not embraced management's desired culture of the company, and they are not being held accountable to it.-----Original Message-----From: Assessment Administrator Sent: 4/5/2022 2:20 PM To: Pace, Jamie Cc: Subject : About your day (1 of 2) This e-mail and the one that follows contain some final questions for you.

I started handling each as I received them, but then tried to read ahead and make sure I didn't have any new information to include. Also, I put off a few less pressing issues until later in the day, and then sent out some additional emails to cover themes that kept coming up.2. Please list the major categories of issues or problems facing Final Assembly in the Bridgeport facility of Soundproof Solutions. The major problem with the assembly line is the growing pains associated with implementing a new quality system (SEQUENCE). I think the program has people frustrated, which is leading to conflict. There is also a lack of shared vision, so everyone is working with their own goals. There also seems to be a lack of respect and professionalism.3. Describe why each entry in Question 2 is an issue or problem. The trouble implementing SEQUENCE is a problem because it can affect morale, which will affect production. There is always going to be some level of resistance to change, but this roll out seems to need more employee buy in. The lack of shared vision will also hold up progress and result in lower morale and less efficiency.Original Message-----From: Assessment Administrator Sent: 4/5/2022 2:21 PM To: Pace, Jamie Cc: Subject : About your day (2 of 2) Following are some of the e-mails that you received today, along with some questions about how you approached them.

Why did you feel that the e-mails you rated as most important were critical? I felt that keeping a customer was most important. Theft of company information was the most time sensitive because security was ready to fire someone. And professional conduct needs to be addressed before it gets any worse or something ends up being a formal HR investigation. They are more ""rules"" that need to be shared as opposed to trying to change a work culture that can take some time to digest.3.Todays assessment provided you with background information about Soundproof Solutions and also presented thechallenging messages listed above.

In light of the recent issues that we've had in the Trim Group, I'm open to discussions regarding her relocation but would be very interested in understanding from your perspective what might be a good fit for her skills.

If so, what areas of improvement within Trim would allow her to be more successful?Please let me know.Respectfully,Thomas","J.J.,Thank you for reaching out to me. Although I cannot comment on rumors regarding the absorption of employees from the Kirkland plant, I would urge you to trust in several items. All employees of Soundproof Solutions are knowledgeable and well trained to perform the tasks that they are assigned.

The future of Soundproof lies heavily on creating exceptional products and having excellent customer relations.Robin,Regarding Keith Baggus, please discuss with him immediately that his behavior and comments are unacceptable and if this behavior continues we will be having very frank discussions with HR about his future at Soundproof.J.J.,Regarding Larry and Harry, please re convey the importance of SEQUENCE and its place in the future success of Soundproof.

Please describe your approach.I initially approached each item as i received it and then transitioned to doing the prep work for each of the face to face meetings. I then tried filling the gaps with the additional emails and requests that came in. I very much ran short of time as i analyzed and prepared my approach and would have appreciated additional time to handle items such as the suggestion box idea.2.

Describe why each entry in Question 2 is an issue or problem.There is a great deal of misunderstanding of what SEQUENCE can bring to the table. All staff members seem distrustful.Implementingtrust around the process will be the biggest hurdle moving forward, but if it is successful, it will be the key to an improved culture in the group. There is a need to further develop and incorporate the Leads for my department as Robin has a great technical background, Pat has the trust of his people and J.J has the attitude of helping to improve anything that he can (assuming that he isn't stealing information and that my gut is correct that he was pulling information for his improvement idea). Collectively they make one good lead and creating a family and team environment amongst them will lead to success for the entire division and company. They all need to keep the big picture in mind when making their daily decisions. Overall, there needs to be a better culture of unity in the company, not only in Group A Line 1, but in all of production.Original Message-----From: Assessment Administrator Sent: 4/5/2022 2:21 PM To: Pace, Jamie Cc: Subject : About your day (2 of 2) Following are some of the e-mails that you received today, along with some questions about how you approached them.

Why did you feel that the e-mails you rated as most important were critical?The emails listed above were the most critical because they required immediate handling, Theft of Company information is substantiated would result in termination of JJ, Professional Misconduct of several employees especially that of Keith Baggus is unacceptable and must be dealt with immediately, and Interaction you saw earlier today between Emily and Larry as workplace conduct issues have the ability to poison the entire work environment.Regarding the most important operational emails that would impact operations (especially while i'm away) it would be Corporate Audit, Upgrades to Robot Software and the Suggestion Box idea, as they would all ultimately have impacts to my team while i would be out of the office.

If so, please list specific examples of theseinstances (Example: Message X related to Message Z, Company Policies related to Message Y, etc.). One specific example was the tie to Theft of Company Information to the Turntable Proposal email. Ultimately, the Turntable proposal email could be the job saving opportunity for JJ, assuming the information that he has downloading directly related to that project. Ultimately, many of the emails as well as the interactions listed in this assessment indicate a lack of understanding of the SEQUENCE problem (SEQUENCE TALK, Interaction you saw earlier today, Professional Conduct, and Job Rotation)."
GJinAVRCuDU,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"J.J.,Thank you for taking time to inform me of the concern with Debby's performance. Moving someone from one place to another inside the company does not address the root issue. I will work with our HR dept. to address the issue. Please be patient and remember that we are all on the same team here at Soundproof Solutions.Thanks,Tim, Good morning Karen,I received the below email from my trim install team leader. It is in regards the work performance of Debby Britzki. Do you have any information in her employee file that would shed light on the issues mentioned below? It sounds like this is an ongoing problem - not something new that just started happening. Let me know if you can shed any light on this situation. Background information will assist me in the counseling process.Thanks,Jamie","J.J.At this point I am not certain if we will be hiring any of the former Kirkland plant employees. If we do they will be expected to perform to the standard that Soundproof Solutions sets forth for its employees. It is pre-mature to judge people based on a rumor. I encourage you to be open to training these individuals, should we hire them. The hiring process at Soundproof Solutions is fair and does not discriminate so we will not be hand picking who we get. Please remember that our company values include mutual respect for others. Part of this respect is considering the ideas of others, even if they come from a different company. Let me know if you have any more concerns with this or need more clarity.Thanks,Jamie,",NA,NA,NA,"Shea,Thank you for reaching out to me regarding the SEQUENCE meeting with Al. I am aware of the concerns with the new initiative but I am hopeful that this meeting will clarify the company's position and answer any concerns the employees have. April 21st works for me. Please set the meeting for 12:00pm - 1:00pm in room BP07. This will allow team members to complete the meeting during normal working hours.Thanks,Jamie,","Jennifer,Thank you for bringing this to my attention. I can see the trend and I agree that it is not good. I will forward this information to the team lead for trim installation. Please keep me informed on product quality issues throughout the month of April. I want to slow and stop this trend as soon as possible. Data from your department will assist me in measuring success.Thanks,Jamie, J.J.,Please see the email below and the attached repair metrics for the trim installation group. There has been an increase in repairs for the month of March.One suggestion I have is to ensure that all of your team members are familiar with the procedures. Team members with more experience, like Larry, should be mentoring the less experienced team members. Please reply to this email and let me know what your plan is to reduce the number of repairs needed at trim installation.Thanks,Jamie",NA,"J.J.,I am happy to hear that you have found a way to improve our process however I have a concern with how you went about devising the idea. Taking company information home and sharing it with classmates is not acceptable. Company information is confidential and needs to be kept at the plant. When company information is shared with outside sources, such as your classmates, it exposes our operations to competitors.Do not place the order for these turntables yet. I would like to sit down with you and look over the design. I also need to vet the process by which you came up with this design.

Please be sure to keep my team leaders up to date on any changes to the schedule or issues after the installation on the 15th. Can you please email me any start-up guides or initial procedures? It would be helpful to have this information during the test phase and before the formal training happens in May.Thanks,Jamie,",NA,"Cory,Attached are the results from the effort that Paul led to motivate Pat and J.J. to cross train in each others positions. Pat is the winner and the recipient of the victory lunch. Please plan on buying lunch for Pat on the 7th. I will set up a meeting for after my return and review the results of the survey with both Pat and J.J.Thanks,Jamie,",NA,"Vic,This is troubling information but I have some concerns that need to be addressed before we perform a termination. I am including Karen on this reply as I would like to better understand our policies regarding investigation and termination of employees. Was a formal interview done with J.J. by HR? Also, do you have any reason to believe that J.J. meant to use the information he was gathering to harm the company?Please hold off on terminating J.J. I need the above questions answered as soon as possible.Karen,Please reply and let me know what Soundproof's policies are regarding company information and employee discipline and termination.Thank you,Jamie,","1. I did not handle each challenge in the order I received. I would read the emails and then prioritize based on what I felt was more important. Personnel and production issues took precedence over other issues.2. Product quality and team performance are the two major categories facing issues at the facility.3. The issue with product quality is seen in the warranty claim by Doxy and in the broken screws that came from Quinn's team to Pat's team. The team performance issues are evidenced in the concerns raised by Alex during the facility tour and by the poor SEQUENCE performance on Pat's team.-----Original Message-----From: Assessment Administrator Sent: 4/5/2022 2:20 PM To: Pace, Jamie Cc: Subject : About your day (1 of 2)  This e-mail and the one that follows contain some final questions for you.

QggLqsSRODe,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Karen -I am planning to coach Larry on his interaction with Emily that I witnessed while walking down the plant with Cory earlier today. I wanted to make sure you were aware of what was occurring in case so you wouldn't be caught offguard with any blowback. I plan to use the MPC coaching model. If there are any other suggestions you may have please let me know as soon as possible as I plan to talk to Larry at the end of his shift.Jamie,NA,"J.J.Thanks for the heads up. on the absenteeism. I understand it's definitely a problem and does cause lost of quality/re-work issues. I will definitely talk to Debby and see if it's a coaching/training issue. We'll also need to see if its a physical constraint issue and if so, does ADA apply. If none of these do apply, then we'll have to involve HR. The personal problems you reference could be protected under FMLA, so that's why HR needs to be involved.You saw my note to Cory recognizing the struggles we have with absenteeism and how it impacts quality, so there is management focus and support on this issue but it is also an area ripe with legal pitfalls.Before we go to far down the rabbit hole of make assumptions, let's start with these facts and then move on. I hear and am empathetic to your frustration and will do whatever I can to help.Jamie.","J.J.I can't confirm any rumors now as I haven't been informed of any moves. However, in any case similar to what you describe, the company would likely be analyzing any new member on their strengths and weaknesses and placing that person where they have the best chance of succeeding. That may mean we will take on a new member that does not have the same level of understanding of SEQUENCE that current employees have. However, if SEQUENCE is done correctly, it shouldn't cause significant longer term issues. If I am told of any relocations, I'll get the team together to discuss them.Jamie",NA,NA,NA,"Shea --Let's go with a Lunch Meeting on the 21st. Given the size of my group, let's go with BP07.

So I either made tasks or made notes on some of the emails so I could pick up my thoughts and complete the tasks and/or take care of the issues later in the assessment once the emails slowed down. 2. Please list the major categories of issues or problems facing Final Assembly in the Bridgeport facility of Soundproof Solutions. Absenteeism was a big problem with quality and morale. Some employee groups felt they weren't engaged properly with the roll out of SEQUENCE, Generational issues were also plaguing one group. Communication improvement up and down the management structure was sorely needed also. 3. Describe why each entry in Question 2 is an issue or problem. Absenteeism was driving quality issues (see Doxy) as well as morale issues. The discussions with Robin and Pat were all centered on communication, and the Pat conversation was heavy with generational conflict undertones.Original Message-----From: Assessment Administrator Sent: 4/5/2022 2:21 PM To: Pace, Jamie Cc: Subject : About your day (2 of 2) Following are some of the e-mails that you received today, along with some questions about how you approached them.

Why did you feel that the e-mails you rated as most important were critical?1.)Theft - J.J. seemed like an important employee and was about to get fired completely on false pretenses, had that occurred, it would have devastatedmorale and likely suppressedany ""above and beyond"" efforts by any other employees. 2.) The interaction between Larry and Emily could be consideredharassment and is not tolerated in any work environment. Allowing it to continue would cause not only put the company at legal risk, but more importantly could cause emotional distress to the harassed party. The Conduct email was also part of this too, I just did not have time to address that message. The message was also a little confusingon who said what - unlike the Larry-Emily exchange. 3.) The Warranty Claim email carried with is a huge risk-reward for the company. The Model 1's are very large units and presumably very expensive. A large account with the potential for a large order of high margin units is a high priority.3.Todays assessment provided you with background information about Soundproof Solutions and also presented thechallenging messages listed above.

hjyeVVVdBEL,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"J.J.I understand your frustrations with the issues you are having with Debby. Moving Debby to another team will not fix the issues we are having. Have you tried talking to her about the issues and see why she is coming in late, having high absenteeism, or why her performance is low on bad days? I will out be for the next couple weeks so if you could have discussions with her the next time you see one of these behaviors to see why this may be happening. Sometimes just talking to Debby and finding out the why can help us come up with a solution to the problems she may be having. When I return I would like to meet with you to discuss what you have found out from your discussions with her and help you find solutions and get results.Thanks,Jamie,","J.J.Thanks for voicing your concerns with whom we may get from the Kirkland plant. I understand what your saying about individuals that take longer to pick up on technology than others. My mother is contacting me all the time to come and help her figure out an issue she is having with her TV or how to use her new I-PAD. Usually my 8 year old daughter can fix all the issues she is dealing with but then whenI think about it, there is a lot of times my 8 year old daughter knows more about it than I do. If and when we get employees from the Kirkland plant we need to keep and open mind and understand that there is going to be a learning curve but it is going to be a good thing bringing these employees in with an outside perspective. We have been operating the same lines for years and we may not be seeingsomething that can help us improve due to complacency. I would like to hear your thoughts on what would be the best way to onboard these new employees and what could we do to bring them up to speed on our current technology the fastest. Thanks and I look forward to hearing your thoughts and ideas on how to incorporate new employees from Kirkland. Also let me know if you have any other concern or thoughts about this situation.Jamie,",NA,"Alex,Sorry for the issues Velma had at the plant today. I will be sure to discuss this with my work group and ensure it doesn't happen again. Is there anyway you could get with Velma to see if she could verify which employees were causing these issues? I see where below we are assuming a few employees were the culprit but before I have a one on one conversation with these employees I want to make sure we are not just assuming who they are based on the employees history.Thanks again for letting me know and I will assure you it will not happen again.Jamie,",NA,NA,"J.J. and Emily,Below is an email from Jamie about our Trim Install repairs for March. There were several days in March with the repairs were excessive. It appears that went certain individuals are absent the repairs needed tend to go up. Could you twoplease look into to this and let me know what your thoughts. Since this is your line and you have a better understanding on what is going on I would like for you to investigate it and make recommendations on how to prevent this in the future. I would like J.J. to take the lead on the investigation with Emily's assistance. Let me know if you need any additional resources to aid you in your investigation.Thanks,Jamie,",NA,"J.J.,This is an excellent idea to speed up trim installation using a turntable. I appreciate all the efforts you have put in on this and even working on this on your own time to ensure it is the right thing to do. This is definitely the kinds of things we are looking for here at Sound Proof Solutions to help reduce the cost per unit sold to help us stay competitive. At this time please hold off on contactingBarrett Remini on placing an order. We should finish up with our Smart Changes evaluation before making a final decision. This allows us to have others look at the idea and to make sure we are not missing anything. Also, with Carson being to busy to assist we need to give time for the engineering group to look at the design to make sure it is exactly what we need and make sure it is ergonomically correct. As you know safety is our number one priority.Keep up the great work and I included Emily Carson in this email so she can give us an update on where we are with the Smart Change evaluation for this change. Emily could you please give me a timeline on when we believe this evaluation will be completed and let me know if there is anything I could do to assist in keeping this moving.Thanks,Jamie, J.J.I have set up a meeting for when I return to work on April 21st at 9:00am so we can discuss the turntable project.",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Vic,Thanks for letting know about the issue with Pat and possibly stealing files. Before you terminate him I think we should investigate this further. Pat has been a great employee and hasn't had any other issues in the past that I am aware of. Pat may have really just been researching an issue. Please hold off on the termination pending further investigation. I have include HR Manager and Cory so they are aware of my recommendation.Thanks,Jamie,","Answers below-----Original Message-----From: Assessment Administrator Sent: 4/5/2022 1:20 PM To: Pace, Jamie Cc: Subject : About your day (1 of 2) This e-mail and the one that follows contain some final questions for you. Your answers to these questions will help us evaluate your performance by giving us a better understanding of your approach to the challenges you faced. It is therefore very important that you provide complete and thorough answers to the questions below and on the e-mail that follows.To reply to the questions in these messages, simply click the Reply button above and enter your responses in the form of a reply e-mail.1. Did you handle each challenge in the order you received it, or did you handle them another way? Please describe your approach.I answered them based on which ones required responses by the end of the day and once realizing several of them were requiring response by end of day, I start to prioritize them more by importance.2. Please list the major categories of issues or problems facing Final Assembly in the Bport facility of Soundproof Solutions.Major issues I see is the lack of communication and leadership that the employees had in the past. Also the entire facility needs to work as a team versus by line or department.3. Describe why each entry in Question 2 is an issue or problem.Lack of Communication: This is a problem because employees from other lines don't know what problems lines upstream and downstream are seeing and why. So this leads to blaming others and coming up with your own reasons which are typically negative to another group or department. Communication on the SEQUENCE program seemed to lack and the employees didn't understand the WHY and what the SEQUENCE program was going to do for them.Leadership/Team Work: Each department was working in silos and making changes that affected downstream sections in the line and wasn't taking that into consideration. They need to involve everyone that will be affected by a change. Previous leaders were not dealing with issues which just compounds problems in the long run. This is why moral is low.Original Message-----From: Assessment Administrator Sent: 4/5/2022 1:21 PM To: Pace, Jamie Cc: Subject : About your day (2 of 2) Following are some of the e-mails that you received today, along with some questions about how you approached them.

To respond, simply click the Reply button above and enter your answers in the form of a reply e-mail. Turntable proposal: New turntable design for trim installExplained that this was a great idea but we were not following the policies at the company which requires us to vet changes through the smart sequence process.The right thing to do to prevent causing more money in the long runis to fullyvet itto ensure we can do it before making a purchase. Victory lunch: Al and Paul will buy lunch for the group leader with better performance survey results Read email but didn't respond because wasn't urgent enough at the time. This should not be done this way because we should not compare scores to individuals as competition and show each other the scores of others. Interaction you saw earlier today: Larry Hodges and Emily Carson disagree about SEQUENCESent an email to each individual explaining that I needed to talk to them. I gave a Larry a little more background because I felt as he started it but wanted to talk to Emily because she didn't end it professionally. But I didn't do much in an email because this type of coaching shouldn't be done over the email. Debby Britzki: Request to move a team member with performance problems to another teamI felt as we need to do more to develop Debby into a good employee. You can't just keep moving people around so I asked the team lead to work with Debby to find the underlying issues to make her better vs move on to another department.  Kirkland plant: Concern about team members transferring from an older plantI challenged the team lead to help come up with solution to better onboard these people from the other plant. There is going to be learning challenges but we have to develop the employees. Team focus: Data indicate higher error rates when the team lead cant support the group Upgrades to robot software: IT proposes software rollout planDidn't get to but needs looked at Professional conduct: Salesperson unnerved by team member behavior during customer tourDidn't get to because I can do this when I return from vacation. Not until April 26th. And we were sure what employees were really involved to have a talk with them about it. SEQUENCE talk: Workers grumbling over extra effort without extra pay under SEQUENCEDidn't respond to because on April 21st and I will be back to finalize plans. This is something others can decide if needed before I return. Corporate audit: Request to prepare department for corporate review of operationsSent out information to inform people it was going to happen and set expectations and what they are looking for. Employees are good and know what needs to be done. Suggestion box: Proposal for an incentive plan to increase team members suggestionsGood idea so made comments to make it better and support it. Helped with rollout plan Warranty claim: Request for a plan to investigate warranty claims for a customers new unitsSent Cory info due to the importance of the claim.  Job rotation: Suggestion that team members rotate jobs to minimize boredom and errorsDidn't get to because it could wait. Nothing pressing and wasn't working anyway. Theft of company information: J.J. Paxton is suspected of stealing company-confidential informationNeeded further investigation. Didn't seem like he was really stilling anything.

hkbocuujygT,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"J.J.,I would like to have a discussion with Larry Hodges whenI return about a hostile confrontation I witnessed. I have a meeting set up for April 21st at 10am. Since you are the Lead I would likeyou to be in attendance. I have attached what I witnessed so you have an idea of what happened. Let me know if you haveany questions or concerns,ThanksAustin",NA,"J.J., While I appreciate your commitment to building a strong team, I don't want to just ""dump"" people off that are seen as a weak link. All this is doing is shifting a perceived problem around without addressing it.As the Lead I want you to come up with a list of ways on how you can help improve her work skillsby the end of the day and send it to me. Concerning her attendance - theabsenteeism will be dealt with through our HR policy and handled accordingly. ThanksJaime","J.J., While I do not know about these rumors, or any truth to them, I think that adding team members from another facility is a good thing. While that plant may be antiquated, thereare still experiences and issues that Kirkland plant employees will have and dealt with that will bring value to the table. As the Lead I want you to embrace any new person and welcome them to the team. It is hard going to a place you are comfortable at to a new place and we need to be sympathetic towards that. By teaching them you may even pick up on some stuff!We can do this (If true)!Austin",NA,"Alex,Thank you for the heads up! I appreciate you coming to me with theseconcerns and issues. Regarding the housekeeping- this has been addressed and I will make sure that all work areas are cleanthroughout the shift. Concerning accusations against Hodges, Vitz, and Baggus -Since Velma isn't confident in who exactly the offenders where, I am going to have to address the wholecrew. I will make sure the expectationis communicated that inappropriate comments and horse playin the work place will not be tolerated. I do not anticipate this being an issue going forward. ThanksAustin",NA,Hi Shea! I can't wait tolearn more about SEQUENCE! I think 12:00-1:00pm is best forour team. I will put this on my calendar. Can we place have room BP07? I hope this meeting will help improve the Teams morale concerning SEQUENCE and see that it is a good program to follow.Thanks!Austin,"Jennifer, Thank you for this information. I will work with my team to drive these repair numbers down. It appears to me that we struggle in this area, even when Larry is here. I will work with Group B Leader to see how they are going about to keep their numbers below the target of 3.ThanksAustin",NA,"J.J.,Firstoff,I want to thank you for your commitment toincreasing efficiency on the trim install!Iam excited to see thefinal product and the time/cost savings that will be experienced with that. I would like more details on thisso that I can put my full support behind itif questionedabout it by others. I have set up a meeting at 10am on April 23rd foryou, Paul,Emily, and myself togo over the details. Please make sure to bring all supporting documentation and cost analysisfor review.Thank you again!Jamie","Hi Isaac!, I look forward to meeting you as well. Thanks for your support to help me out with any programming needs. I am glad I have a resource I can count on. While I am excited for the Robot Software program, I am requesting we hold off until the week of the 25th. Unfortunately I am out of town for the next two weeks and will not be near the office. I know Al Howard wants to get this going, but I think it will be best to hold off untilI am here. That way if there are any issues or concerns I will be able to address them then. Thank you Isaac!Austin",NA,"Cory,Here are the results from the Standard Performance Questionnaire. Pat's scores were better than J.J.s.ThanksJaime",NA,"Vic, First off, thank you for keeping an eagle eye on security! It makes me feel relieved to know that we have passionate and dutiful security. That is the kind of reassurance that lets me know I am safe here. Concerning the disk - J.J. told me about the project he had been working on in his off hours. It was a project to help make his job more efficient and he took some information to get help on it. I do not believe any of this was of malicious or ill intent. Before you confront J.J. can we please meet with HR? While he may have made an infraction that is worthy of some discipline, I would hate to see a dedicated and passionate employee fired over a mistake. I think that would send the wrong message to theworkers -to see their Lead terminated over doing extra work off hours for the company.ThanksJamie","1. Did you handle each challenge in the order you received it, or did you handle them another way? Please describe your approach.I started off by order of reciveing, but as I was getting close to meeting times I had to stop doing that and prioritize emails. If it was something that was duewithin the next 30-45 minutes I would mark that as a higher priority.  2. Please list the major categories of issues or problems facing Final Assembly in the Bridgeport facility of Soundproof Solutions. Communication and support from their Group A Leader. With good communication and good support, the workers will buy into and commit to new programs. 3. Describe why each entry in Question 2 is an issue or problem.Effective communication is hard to obtain when there is alto going on, but it is still a must. Taking the time and ""slowing down"" to allow people the opportunity to absorb information and not just ""shove it down their throats"". A leader that has an open door policy and supports their workers will have workers that support them. When you show the employee you truly value their input and want to know about their thoughts it makes them feel included and important. When someone listens to them it will boost their morale and efficiency and production go up!Original Message-----From: Assessment Administrator Sent: 4/5/2022 1:20 PM To: Pace, Jamie Cc: Subject : About your day (1 of 2) This e-mail and the one that follows contain some final questions for you.

vYOluuoAoLh,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Tracy,That is great information to have. I don't think we need to start sharing this information with other groups or Haley until we have done a larger study. I think it is a great start to this information, but don't need to encourage shorter calls until we have a population larger than 10 daystested. I think that you should share this in our next staff meeting between me and the coordinators to see what steps we can take to ensure that we have the highest customer satisfaction. If you have time to test a larger population, then we can discuss this when I return from vacation and make plans to present to others then.Great work!Thank you,Cary Stevens,",NA,NA,"Taylor,I don't doubt that Jerry is doing great work, but I don't think he needs to be your replacement when you are out on vacation. I will also be out, so I believe that Kim should cover for your responsibilities when necessary. From looking over the survey you sent, I think that Jerry may need a little more coaching before he is ready to perform as a Coordinator. Some of the scores on the lines that are important for leadership don't look great. Inspiring everyone to do their best, blaming problems on others, and going beyond authority didn't get great scores. I think it's great that you are training and mentoring him, but I don't think he is ready to cover your responsibilities yet.Keep up the good work!Cary Stevens,","Alex,Thank you for letting me know. You are correct that is in unacceptable, and I will address my team about this immediately. I apologize for the behavior that our client witnessed.Thank you,Cary Stevens,","Haley,I think we have an exceptional staff, so this was a tough decision. Based on the information you provided to me as well as the ratings that I have reviewed in Barney's information that he left behind, I think that the promotion should go to Corey Thompson. Corey has a performance index of 86% and a productivity of 104%, which is above corporate standard. Corey also scored a 'B' on the Customer Service Ratings and an A+ on the Teamwork Ratings. I think the fact that he scored so high on these ratings while also maintaining great percentages for performance and productivity shows he can balance everything and do a great job. Blaine and Eden have great percentages below, but scored low on the customer service and team ratings.Thank you,Cary Stevens,",NA,NA,"Haley,I would like to nominate Tracy Hurdle, Jess Rollins, and Quinn Labarre.Tracy Hurdle is showing a lot of initiative in her work in and out of the office. She is going back to school and using her classwork to help better our company.Jess Rollins has shown great mentoring and productivity skills. She is looking to learn new things about our company and move into additional roles working with our customers. I would like to give Jess the three credits to complete her training so she can become a Level 2.Quinn Labarre is newer to the group, but already done great work. She picks up on things very quickly and listens to her peers.Thank you,Cary Stevens,",NA,NA,"Taylor,Thank you for letting me know about this situation. I don't think that this is something that you need to be concerned with fixing though. Eluto is not on our team and if hewould like to make a complaint, then he needs to let Judy Blanco know so that they can take the appropriate steps and contact HR. I don't want to start pointing fingers at anyone on our team if we are not positive that they did this.I appreciate you trying to help.Thank you,Cary Stevens,",NA,"Haley,I received the email below from Taylor this morning concerning a customer that seems to be taking advantage of our replacement policy. I let Taylor know that we would need to replace the roll that was just discussed since we already processed that order, but if Tom Weedler contacted them next week after his new order it should be transferred directly to him to discuss. I am alerting you since I will be out of the office next week, and I let Taylor know that if it were necessary he would have to transfer the call to you. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.Thank you,Cary Stevens, Taylor,I understand that this situation is frustrating because it seems like Tom Weedler Contracting is taking advantage of the system. We have had quite a bit of business from Tom, so we have to take that and the fact that the is President of the Home ContractingAssociationinto consideration when we are addressing this situation. We need to send the replacement roll that we already processed to Tom because we didn't address this situation with him when he called initially. If he calls after he receives his order next week with a complaint, then please have the representative transfer the call directly to you. You should let Tom know that we can't continue to send replacement rolls because of the high volume of complaints from himthis year, and because we are not receiving the same complaints from any other customers.If you have any problems, then please transfer the call to Haley Roth since I will be out of the office. I will make sure she is aware of this situation.Thank you,Cary Stevens","Cary,Thank you for this information. I have copied Marge Dalton to this email as I believe this matter needs to be handled by HR before you confront him or take any action. I think confiscating the flash drive is the first thing that needs to be done, and then HR can take care of the procedures for any further action.Thank you,Cary Stevens,","1. I think the biggest issue with Customer Service Team 5 is communication. Whether it be communication with customers, internally, or to other groups, this seemed to be the thing that came across most in the calls and emails. There were some examples of bad communication with customers that resulted in complaints for certain reps and also phone calls from angry customers. There also seemed to be a small staffing issue with Level 2's. I think that there needed to be more on staff to be able to complete the jobs that were requested on the installation schedule. Certain employees also had a hard time not letting personalthings get to them and affect their work, so that could cause problems if not handled correctly.2. The three most important messages were Professional Conduct, Fletcher Systems, and Weedler Contracting. These were high priorities because these were all concerning our customers. Our customers are our main priority, so when a customer is upset or has a concern then we must address it quickly and professionally. Also, if we have any concerns with our customers, then we must discussand think throughbefore taking action.3. There were emails about the Installation schedule that were all related. Not necessarily the jobs themselves, but having to move around jobs on the schedule because a new email would come in needing a specific deadline. The email that included Barney's files was helpful when making the promotion decision because it had some rating sheets. Also, some of the emails concerning Jess the Level 1 staff that was ready to be promoted could be helpful in deciding if she was ready to be nominated in the Bench Strength course email that Haley sent later in the day.4. I think that anytime you are jumping into a company/product you are not familiar with can cause some problems with responses or how things are handled. That being said, I am not sure of any additional information that would have been helpful.-----Original Message-----From: Assessment Administrator Sent: 4/5/2022 1:40 PM To: Stevens, Cary Cc: Subject : RESPONSE REQUIRED: About your day This e-mail contains some final questions for you.

Please describe your approach.I started by looking at them in the order received, but switched to looking at email titles to try to gauge priority given the limited timeframe allowed.2. Please list the major categories of issues or problems facing Final Assembly in the Bridgeport facility of Soundproof Solutions.Major issues included a warranty claim/investigation and ensuring we keep a customer. Other major issues included personnel issues that needed resolved/addressed including Robin, Quinn, and Pat. Also JJ concern of theft of company info3. Describe why each entry in Question 2 is an issue or problem.Issue with the warranty claim as the company keeps quality and customer service as core values. This would also impact keeping the customer if not addressed properly.Personnel conflicts are a concern since this creates a poor work relationship and impacts productivity/focus. Personnel issues need to be addressed ASAP or the issue could get worse or create a poor working environment and culture.knowing JJ was working on items outside of work, I didn't feel it was a huge concern that he was copying company info, but this needs to be approved prior to doing so. This would have been an issue if I missed that email and he was walked out without my approval. We definitely do not want theft of company info, but he was using it to improve processes.Original Message-----From: Assessment Administrator Sent: 4/5/2022 2:21 PM To: Pace, Jamie Cc: Subject : About your day (2 of 2) Following are some of the e-mails that you received today, along with some questions about how you approached them.

Turntable proposal: New turntable design for trim installGood idea and effort, but not high priority. Deferred discussion until after vacation  Victory lunch: Al and Paul will buy lunch for the group leader with better performance survey resultsNot high priority. Thanked both JJ and Pat for their efforts.Interaction you saw earlier today: Larry Hodges and Emily Carson disagree about SEQUENCEImportant to address ASAP. In real life I would have pulled both into my office for a quick discussion, but sent an email in this simulation due to lack of other options. Need to ensure mutual respect in conversations. Debby Britzki: Request to move a team member with performance problems to another teamNot high priority - inquired what he has done to address the issue or coaching provided. coaching is the first priority and a performance development plan, not just trying to move an employee to another team. Address the problem, don't avoid it. Kirkland plant: Concern about team members transferring from an older plantNot a high priority, but will keep an eye out for discussions upon return of vacation Team focus: Data indicate higher error rates when the team lead cant support the groupSent along to the leader of the Trim Install team for him to address. This is something that can be delegated so did not handle directly. I would follow up on this upon my return from vacation. Upgrades to robot software: IT proposes software rollout planNot high priority, but ensured my backfill was in the loop and didn't have any concerns. Professional conduct: Salesperson unnerved by team member behavior during customer tourThis needs addressed ASAP. THis is something I would have dug into further to see who exactly made the comments. I do not like to have blanket coaching sessions, but rather individual coaching to address performance or behavior issues. SEQUENCE talk: Workers grumbling over extra effort without extra pay under SEQUENCEAsk to understand concern and why. Explain to them the WHY behind sequence to get buy-in/support Corporate audit: Request to prepare department for corporate review of operationsAsked team to be prepared for audit via email. Team leads to ensure completed. Suggestion box: Proposal for an incentive plan to increase team members suggestionsNot high priority in my mind prior to a vacation, but it was a request by the boss so provided a plan. Warranty claim: Request for a plan to investigate warranty claims for a customers new unitsHigh priority due to quality issue and potential customer impact. Job rotation: Suggestion that team members rotate jobs to minimize boredom and errorsCame up with a job rotation plan. This is something I would have delegated to the Team Leads in real life so they work together and gain buy-in. Theft of company information: J.J. Paxton is suspected of stealing company-confidential informationTheft of company info is never ok, but given JJ was working on something, it didn't seem like a big deal to me. I do want to ensure he wasn't copying anything else proprietary not related to the project he was working on. Can dig into this further upon return from vacation and ensure he asks for permission prior to doing so.1. What were the three most important and the three least important e-mails to handle?Most important: Warranty claim, Larry & Emily, team focusLeast important:Debby Britzki, Kirkland plant, victory lunch2. Why did you feel that the e-mails you rated as most important were critical?Addressing personnel issues immediatelyis important.

Lack of focus can lead to safety issues, quality, or productivity concerns.3.Todays assessment provided you with background information about Soundproof Solutions and also presented thechallenging messages listed above.

Let's just look how much more we can get things done even if you think it only saves us four minutes doing that job, but let's add that four minutes up during an entire shift and see how much time that saves us. Emily I think if we explained in a little more detail just how much more time we could save on the changes we make would help.

I understand that were going to be absorbing some workers from the Kirkland plant across town, and I figure that my team is bound to get some of them. I know its a lot to ask, but can we pick who theyll be? The Kirkland plant is terribly antiquated, and those people have all been there since the company openedthey dont know anything about technology. I remember how long it took to teach my mother how to use an automated teller at the bankteaching these folks about SEQUENCE and all of the technology we use will take forever.

Thank you both again for a job well done and keep up the good work.",NA,"Vic, I think before we make that drastic a decision we are going to need a little more information. J.J. might have been working on something. We should get all the information you have file a report and go to HR before we go to such drastic extremes. J.J. might have had something he and Paul had set up and he assumed Paul had advised me what was going on, even though I have not been made aware of anything. I think you should sit down and talk to J.J. and get some more details as too why he was doing this.

If it were to occur, I would concur with you that employees will be distributed across the teams. I highly doubt that we will get to hand pick any candidates for any of the teams. Most likely, if they align with our functions that would be a start but I would challenge each lead to be working to dust off, review, and update any training/on-boarding packets we have. If there are postions we don't have those developed than that needs to occur.Please work to do that, as it's good to have for new hires anyway, but would be available if any transition would occur between the plants.

Disseminating this information outside of the company is a security breach, and you and I will need to have a discussion with Human Resources about the consequences. Please come to my office today at 1:30 so we can have that conversation.I appreciate that you are looking at how statistics and data can help us better serve our customers. However, in the future, please bring such information to me for discussion, rather than taking outside the company, Let's discuss further this afternoon.Thanks,Cary",NA,NA,"Hi Taylor,I think that it's great that you've found a mentee and that you are working together so well. I'm encouraged by the progress Jerry is showing. Please continue to keep me up to date on your plans and his progress. I'm fine with him stepping in for you this Thursday and Friday.

Having said that, I would like to move forward with promoting Ashley Payne.

I think she's ready to move up to a full time position.Thanks!Cary",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Taylor,Thanks for bringing this to me. Mr. Weedler may well be taking advantage of our replacement policy, however he may also genuinely looking out for his own customers, and trying to meet their high standards. It is up to us to ensure all our customers are ultimately satisfied with every aspect of our products and services, so let's take a proactive approach to his upcoming order.I would like you to set up a meeting, by phone or preferably in person if that is possible, with Mr. Weedler on the day that his products are delivered for his next order. Please work with him to ensure that his order is complete and all products delivered meet his expectations. If there are any issues with any of the products, please write them up for replacement. If you meet in person, please bring the rejected product back with you. Otherwise please ask Mr. Weedler to send the rejected product back within 15 days, at our expense. We may need to work with him more on the front end for his next few orders just to ensure that we are delivering what he needs the first time, every time. Let's also ensure we are adhering to our policy on replacements. If we aren't getting the rejected product back within the standard 15 day time limit, we need to make sure they appear on the invoice.Thank you,Cary","Liang,Thanks so much for bringing this to my attention. I understand your concern about Tracy's actions. Tracy shared with me today that he used company data for a class project. While I don't think he had nefarious intentions regarding this data, I do recognize that his actions constitute a security breach, and that we must address that.I have set up a meeting with Tracy, and am including Marge from Human Resources, so that we can discuss this breach and the consequences Tracy will face. We will also talk about proper handling of company data. At this time, please wait until you have further instructions from Human Resources before you escort Tracy from the building. I truly think that after our discussion this afternoon, he will handle company information with the sensitivity it deserves.Thank you,Cary","Good afternoon,1. Some of the major issues facing Team 5, I think, are lack of communication and direction. I think that the representatives have been given a lot of agency to innovate and act on their own, which is great, however I also think that they are too ready to move forward with projects before they have communicated with team leader and key stakeholders. Therefore I don't think they have adequate perspective on the effect some of these plans may have on other areas in the company. I also see some training issues and inconsistency with how the team handles customer calls. i'd like to see some additional training to make sure all reps are on the same page.2. I think the most important message was Mr. Wilson's. He is an important customer who inherited a problem, and his hospital provides the potential for future business, so I think it was key to make him happy. I think the message from the stat student was important to deal with because it exposed a weakness in our security program as well as a training opportunity. Finally I feel the email from the person complaining about how another employee was treated about his food was very important, because that person was not being respected by his co-workers and that is counter to the company's vision. However i ran out of time before addressing it.3. I noted the link between the security guard and the statistics student. There was definitely an issue that needed to be addressed with the student, but I think the security guard overreacted a bit.4. It really would have been helpful to have several windows, emails and documents open at the same time. This would have been especially helpful with scheduling.Thanks!-----Original Message-----From: Assessment Administrator Sent: 4/5/2022 1:50 PM To: Stevens, Cary Cc: Subject : RESPONSE REQUIRED: About your day This e-mail contains some final questions for you.

Paxton downloading files from a computer onto a disk and putting the disk in a knapsack. When J.J. went to lunch, I removed the disk from the knapsack and examined it. I found that it contained detailed data on our operations. It was definitely company confidential information.I confronted J.J., who claimed that it was just research on a shop floor issue that he was working on in his off time. Frankly, it sounded like he was trying to think of an excuse as fast as he could.After having some time to think about it, I decided that I would confront J.J. and escort him from the building by the end of the shift today. Then Ill get the paperwork going to have J.J. officially terminated. I thought you might want to know.-VicVic DaishaSupervisor, Plant Security",NA

QgZDdvPdohY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Hi J.J.Since I'm new to the group, I'm not familiar with Debby's past performance issues. I don't want to write someone off entirely without better understanding what personal problems they might be going through.Have we had discussions with Debby in the past to see what issues she's been having and set expectations for being on time? If we better understand her issues, we might be able to be more flexible with her schedule and personal life. If she is having a bad day, we probably need to a better job of checking in on her to ensure she's staying focused and not creating quality issues.Since I'll be out of the office for two weeks, please have an informal and polite discussion with her about her absenteeism while I'm out. See if there's anything we could do to help her perform better. If she continues to have absentee and performance issues, then I will sit down with her when I return. It could be that moving her to another group will work better with her personal life, but I think we need to try to help her succeed in our team before we resort to that.Thanks,Jamie","Hey J.J.,I doubt we will have absolute control over who comes into our group, but it certainly makes sense that company will want to put employees into positions where they will be the most successful. I emailed HR to see how much control I will have over the employee placement process, and I'll do my best to identify good fits for our culture and our team.No matter who we get, we need to make sure we welcome them with open arms and take the time to get them up to speed on SEQUENCE and our way of doing business. Change is hard for any organization, but it will certainly be hardest on the new employees. We have an obligation to make sure they are trained, welcome, and ready to help the area keep improving. I'll let you know what I hear back from HR.Thanks,Jamie",NA,"Alex,I have immediately addressed this with my team. This behavior is unacceptable and we will not tolerate it in the future. Thank you for bringing it to my attention. We will keep a close eye on this going forward. My apologies to Velma and tour members.thank you,Jamie",NA,"Shea,Let's plan to have the discussion in BP07 at lunch time. We have 31 team members so that room will work well and the round tables will foster some inclusion and interaction.Please take Al up on his offer and buy lunch for everyone. I don't know what our team members prefer, but please check with everyone to ensure we've accounted for any dietary restrictions. Send the meeting invite to the team when all the details are finalized.Thank you,Jamie","Jennifer,It looks to me like we are making more errors when J.J. has to cover on the line.It just came to my attention that Pat Landis and J.J. recently cross trained on each others jobs with great success for both. It might be time for a change of leadership in the Trim Installation department. I plan to discuss this move with Cory later today.We also have to do more to combat absenteeism, or have a better plan in place to cover when employees are off or on vacation. Robin Moskowitz did an excellent job the day she covered, so we may consider utilizing her more.Please look for an improvement in this department next month.Thank you,Jamie",NA,"J.J.,This is exactly the sort of innovative solution that we need to improve our SEQUENCE metrics. Awesome job by you, Emily, and Paul!Please proceed with placing the order with Barrett today. I'm copying Carson and the other Group Leaders so that they can be aware of this idea as well. If it works well for us, they might want to implement it on their lines.Again, fantastic job developing this idea and driving it through to implementation. This sort of ownership and innovation is what will make us successful in the future.Thank you,Jamie","Hi Isaac,I'm looking forward to meeting you too. It sounds like this will be a great change for the organization, so we should try to roll it out as soon as possible. However, I do have some concerns with the roll out plan. First of all, should we not provide some training to the team before the software is rolled out? I believe that would help reduce the growing pains and improve the feedback from the employees who will be using it. If you or one of your team members could come train the team on Thursday April 14 or earlier, then we could probably proceed with the April 15 install date. I would want someone from your team onsite during the installation just in case anything goes wrong that could impact production. If the old software will be uninstalled on 4/15, we may need onsite support or at least readily available technical support during the trial period.I will be out of the office from 4/6 through 4/20, so I am copying Robin, Pat, J.J., and Emily to ensure they can keep their teams informed.Robin, Pat, and JJ, please forward any feedback on the new software to me so that I can review it after getting back from vacation.Issac, I should be able to forward that feedback to you on 4/22 per your schedule below once I get back.Please give me a call if you want to discuss further. Otherwise, please work with Robin, Pat, J.J. and Emily to schedule the software training prior to the 4/15 roll out.Thank you,Jamie",NA,"Cory,I already sent you the results in a separate email, but as you can see below, Pat was the clear winner in the cross training challenge. Sounds like you owe him lunch on 4/7. Glad we have these two guys on our team. Sounds like they are both great employees.Jamie",NA,"Vic,Stealing company information is a serious offence, but I don't feel we have all the details here. We need to get together with HR, and Cory and discuss the issue with J.J together in private. This may just be a misunderstanding and I don't want to jump to conclusions too quickly. Please confiscate the disk to prevent the files from being taken offsite by the end of the day. Please meet with Cory, Karen, and J.J. tomorrow to get all the details. Unfortunately I will be unable to attend as I will be on vacation. If formal discipline or dismissal are in order, then we need to go through the proper channels.thank you,Jamie","1.) Each email gave me more insight into the area and the problems that the organization was facing, so I tried to read as many emails as possible as they were coming in, then go back and address problems armed with more knowledge and insight.2./3.) Employee engagement is the most significant issue. There needs to be more communication down through the work force about company goals and priorities. There also needs to be more communication between areas to eliminate quality problems and rework like what occurred between Quinn and Jamie's groups. Employees and areas that work in silos do not understand the big picture and will be less likely to adapt to change and will not collaborate well with other members of the organization. Communicating the company goals (SEQUENCE) to the employees also needs to be a major focus area. There are clear benefits of the system, but it will only succeed if the employees understand and engage with it.-----Original Message-----From: Assessment Administrator Sent: 4/5/2022 2:20 PM To: Pace, Jamie Cc: Subject : About your day (1 of 2) This e-mail and the one that follows contain some final questions for you.

I am sure she will be surprised at the results as well. Even though the results were call times were less and we got satisfaction at high, I don't want to sound like we are pushing to get the customers off the phone. Let's do some more real-world data for a longer period and see what we come up with.

Treats everyone on the team fairly, 2.) Inspires everyone to do their best, 3.) Usually blames problems on people rather than the situation and 4.)

I don't think he is ready to take on a lead position with your team while you are away for two days.Let's give him some more time and coach him in the areas that I have addressed above.Going by the Totals you would think that they place him as an Ideal Coordinator but when you take each piece the story is different.Thank you for your enthusiasm.

If you have staff meetings, I would like for you to bring this up in there in this matter.I hope this helps with the situation.Cary",NA,"Taylor,Company policy states that we will replace unopened products for refund or exchange within 90 days of purchase. Is the 90 days past when the material is said to be defective? The policy also states that we will refund or exchange if the product is defective on an opened package.The policy also states that we replace a defective product no questions for the first defective product. If there are other defective products then the customer needs to send in the defective product to get credit for the one we are replacing within 15 days. Otherwise we will charge for the replacement.I think this is the best way to handle this situation so that Mr. Weedler will continue to order from us and at the same time save the company from giving replacements for product that really are not defective.Please keep me updated on this situation in case we need another plan.Thank you,Cary","Liang,Before you do that paperwork, we need to discuss what exactly happened.

Your answers to these questions will help in the evaluation of your performance by providing a better understanding of your approach and rationale. It is important that you provide complete and thorough answers to the questions below.For your reference, a list of messages you received today is shown after question 4.1. Please list the major categories of issues or problems facing Customer Service Team 5 of Soundproof Solutions. Why is each an issue or a problem?All of the team has not completed their bench marks. This is important for everyone to be on schedule for these. It becomes and issue when you team is not on the same page and do not have the same knowledge as everyone.2. What were the three most important messages you considered the highest priorities to handle? Why?1. The complaint was an important messages because customers are our business and without them we don't survive. Making them happy and wanting to come back is imperative.2. The issue with the theft of company property. This becomes an issue if someone is trying to steal our product designs, technology or any other ideas that makes our company who we are. It is important to find these thefts and get rid of them.3. The message about the harassment of an employee. No one should feel uncomfortable in their workplace. We need to make the workplace a safe place to work and some place that employees enjoy being and not uncomfortable.3. List specific examples (if any) of instances where you detected a relationship between two of the messages you received in your inbox. For example, when you decided how respond to one message, did you consider information provided not only in that message, but in other message(s)?The example for coaching Jess was one. There were two people referring to the same issue. The manager and then Jess' boss. The messages I got from both parties helped me to answer the email with more information. I was able to give suggestions on the Task Force and I was also able to see a conversation with a customer.4. Describe what additional information you would have liked to have in order to have a better or clearer understanding of the messages and challenges presented to you today.I don't know if it was my oversight but I got lost in the Installation Calendar and the days that people needed for their projects coming up.

We need to reset and revamp the culture in the groups before making major changes to the group and their knowledge of their job.3.Todays assessment provided you with background information about Soundproof Solutions and also presented thechallenging messages listed above. Were there situations where information from one source/challenge helped you to better understand and address anotherchallenge? If so, please list specific examples of theseinstances (Example: Message X related to Message Z, Company Policies related to Message Y, etc.).I separated the material into 3 sections. Industry & Product; Facility and Organization; and Process Change and Culture. This helped identify where these issues or changes were going to align and provided me a good foundation to build my responses on. Many of the conversations had over the phone were dealing with the Process Change and Culture. Other issues were mostly about sprinkling in industry facts and data to prove the culture needed to change."

At the beginning of the exam I would focus more on Cory Manning's emails and then focus more towards the employees issues.The issues I see that are happening in the Final Assembly area inn Bridgeport seem to me that the employees are not taking there job seriously and are being un-professional at times. Attendance seems to be an issue as well, following with a lot of blaming on others instead of taking the responsibility and fixing the issues that are occurring. If these issues continue, production will fall and Bridgeport will lose customers if actions are not taken.

The least important emails of the day had to be Turntable proposal by J.J, following with the victory lunch as well and finally the moving of Debby Britzki.The reason why the 3 important emails I mention above are important to me is because we need to take pride in our work and work safely while doing so.

VjVLRLIxTDh,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Cory,I have ask J.J. to set up a meeting with Larry to discuss today's interaction with Emily. J.J. will work to understand the issues that Larry has either with Emily directly or with the SEQUENCE. We want to understand the details and get to the root cause of exactly what is causing the friction between the two. I also want HR to be in the loop on this so we can monitor the situation and the progress we want to make on their interactions. Another approach I want to consider is having a discussion with both parties for each to explain their side and understand the role each plays within the company and the positions they hold. Hopefully this approach will help solve the current issues between the two. If not, we will involve HR and have them help with next steps.Thanks,Jason",NA,"J.J.,Thanks for the email and raising the concern about Debby. It sounds like Debby has been on multiple Teams in the plant over time. I do have a few questions/comments we need to address before Debby is just moved to another Team. We all have problems at personally and professionally which affect our production at work.Have we discussed this with Debby and that we all have to figure out how to handle and work through problems when we seem to get in a rut. It will be different for all of us but we have to help her understand how to do that. Listening and understanding to these concerns/problems will help improve morale and most likely the absenteeism.Are Team members engaging Debby and including her as part of the larger Team?If not, this will affect production and morale.Have you talked with Debby prior to wanting to send to another Team?Have we set goals and objectives for Debby and frequent check-in's to see how she is doing and how things are going?If we have completed all of the above and nothing to date has helped drive a change have we engaged HR to have discussions on performance?Please let me know when you would like to discuss further.Thanks,Jason","J.J.,Thanks for the email and concern.Yes, we will be absorbing some employees from the Kirkland plant. I understand your concern and that the Kirkland plant may be more antiquated than ours. We will not be choosing which employees will be coming over as that decision will be made by the leadership team. With that being said, prior to them coming over our Team will be having a meeting to discuss welcoming and getting them up to speed on our organization. This meeting will consist of our Group 1 leads and HR. We will talk with Emily on SEQUENCE and working to get them in training to understand the process and how they fit in and apply it to their daily job. We will plan Team meetings with each department during work hours to help the social aspect, welcome and build morale of the entire Team. Even if the Kirkland plant does not have our technology we can help bring them up to speed on what we have and how the Bridgeport plan operates. I believe by doing this we will build a stronger Team over time and how SEQUENCE makes us more safe, efficient and productive over time.Please let me know if you have any questions or would like to discuss further.Thanks,Jason",NA,"Alex,Thanks for the emails and bringing up the concerns. Please understand that we will address these items immediately.For the team members making fun of SEQUENCE will have a team meeting to address and discuss SEQUENCE and its importance to Soundproof Solutions being a successful company within the industry. We will discuss how each team member plays an important role within SEQUENCE to help the company achieve its goals and being a top performer in the market. As far as the issue raised by Velma, I agree that is embarrassing and will not be tolerated. I will meet with J.J. Paxton and Karen Duvalier to talk through this issue and ensure it is handled appropriately. I know Velma believes it was Keith and we will work to verify that exactly and deal with the parties involved on an individual basis following the progressive discipline policy.The housekeeping issue is also a concern not jut when visitors are coming through the plant but anytime. This is not in line with SEQUENCE or how we want to operate safely. I will meet with my entire team and set expectations for each department on safety, housekeeping and leading by example as we move forward.Please let me know if you have any questions or need additional information.Thanks,Jason",NA,"Shea,Thanks for the update and the potential concerns the team might have on SEQUENCE. I would like to propose the following for the April 21 meeting. Lets plan for 2:00 - 3:00 PM during work hours to show the team the importance Al and the entire leadership team is putting behind SEQUENCE. Its important enough for us to stop production on the Line for an hour to have meaningful discussion.I would propose conference room BP07. I feel that round tables are more collaborative than others and it will also give us a flip chart. If team members do have concerns we can note those as ""parking lot"" items on the flip chart for further follow-up by the SEQUENCE team which can be reviewed at a later meeting. I am also hoping that Al will be here in person for this meeting to show support for the process and meet each of the team members.Please let me know if you have any questions or need further information.Thanks,Jason","Jennifer,Thanks for the email and summary of March repairs and absences for Trim Install. After reviewing, I agree we had an excessive repair rate multiple days throughout the month. In looking a little deeper the two days that Larry missed the repairs were up but they were up multiple other days as well. I feel there may be a deeper issue needing addressed than one person carrying the Team on any given day. I will set up meetings with J.J. to start the discussions around his Team and how things are operating and a plan moving forward. Vacation days speak for themselves but we need to look closer at the absences. We will be working to set up Team meetings on a routine basis to build morale and Team interaction. J.J. and I will be reviewing this information monthly and making adjustments and tweaks as needed to ensure that repairs are minimal and we are helping the plant operate as efficiently as possible.Please let me know if you would like to discuss further or have any questions.Thanks,Jason",NA,"J.J.Thanks for the email and update I appreciate it! By reading your email it sounds like there is a potential for some production improvements. As we move forward with SEQUENCE and looking at everything with a broad view please send me all the information on the proposal at your earliest convenience. I would like to review and understand all the information prior to ordering and purchasing. Please set up a meeting the week of April 25 with the Team to review the proposal. Once we are confident we have a solid proposal we can review with Cory Manning and get the approval to order the new equipment for installation.Please let me know if you have any questions or would like additional information.Thanks,Jason","Isaac,Great to hear from you and look forward to meeting you in person as well. Thanks for reaching out on the new software and it sounds like lots of work has already been done to ensure a smooth transition. If you have talked this plan over with my team and they are comfortable with moving forward I am good as well. We have a strong team and I am confident if they are good to test the software we can help provide some valuable feedback for any adjustments that might need made prior to the official roll out. I do not have a problem with the plan other than just a couple comments/suggestions.Can we install the software on Saturday April 16 instead of April 15 to avoid taking the entire system down? If this takes down production for an entire day and we are not going to test until Monday, April 18 can we install over the weekend?I will be on vacation starting tomorrow until April 20. Upon my return I will start to review all the comments/issues/concerns with the software the team has gathered and we will get this over to you by the COB April 22.Thanks for the opportunity to comment and look forward to working with you on this project and others in the future.Thanks,Jason",NA,"Paul,Thanks for the information I appreciate it!Cory, I have reviewed and propose the following. We should by lunch for both and congratulate them with no clear winner announced but that they were both winners in multiple ways. The last thing I want to do is start to create unhealthy competition between our team members. While cross training is extremely important we could do this study within the groups they currently manage. Each did exceptionally well in some areas while having room for improvement in others. I would suggest we take the results and the opportunity to have a positive conversation with each on what they are doing well and some potential opportunities for improvement. Maybe we could even look to add this into our yearly performance reviews at some point.Please let me know if you have thoughts or need additional information.Thanks,Jason",NA,"Vic,Thanks for the email and heads up. Before we confront J.J. I would like for us to involve Karen Duvalier and her team to complete a formal investigation. While I know you believe you saw detailed data operations on the disk we need to fully examine and understand what data and material is there. We also need to interview J.J. and get his side of the story prior to anything being done which can also be led by Karen's team.Vic, please do not take any further actions at this time until you hear from either Karen or myself.Karen, I will be giving you a call to discuss our path forward and how we approach J.J. about the incident today.Thanks,Jason","Assessment Administrator,1.) I handled each in the order it was received. This is the I try to handle my daily business currently and be as responsive to items as possible.

I know you will be working with them directly on your team so if there is an opportunity I may reach out to you for input as well.

There were several times during the calls that I referenced information from other emails or tried to get answers to questions without directly informing them that I already had the responses, in this way the other participant wouldn't feel attacked.Final assembly issuesPoor implementation/rollout of SEQUENCENot everyone seems to understand how it is supposed to work or what the benefits are. This could result in the failure of SEQUENCE which the company has spent a lot of money on, they won't improve their manufacturing processes which means they will still lag behind the competition, and just general morale issues with workers feeling like they are being forced to do something without their buy-in.Competition has created a lack of cooperation between teams and at times a hostile work environmentTeams need to understand that they are all working together to make the final product, if one portion is lagging then it impacts everyone and the company as a whole. Some competition is good to try and perform your best but making en environment where it is OK to no longer consult your peers is a dangerous game that could even result in an injury.They have done a poor job with making employees feel valued in their rolesIf an employee doesn't feel valued then they won't perform at their highest level, instead it is just a job instead of a passion or career. This can also lead to complacency and cost the company money via rework, slow production, and high turnover rates.-----Original Message-----From: Assessment Administrator Sent: 4/5/2022 2:20 PM To: Pace, Jamie Cc: Subject : About your day (1 of 2) This e-mail and the one that follows contain some final questions for you.

Most important: SEQUENCE Talk, Professional Conduct, and Job Rotation; Least Important: Upgrades to robot software, Kirkland Plant, and Corporate AuditCommon feedback were issues with SEQUENCE and how it impacted the employees, either lack of knowledge, lack of training, or poor communication. Since this is a major initiative from corporate we should be doing our best to make sure the individuals putting it into action have bought into the system.This type of behavior is not tolerated in a work place and can cost the company major contracts. This not only reflects poorly on the employee but their supervision as well, and with the upcoming audit while I was on vacation this needed to be addressed immediately.Cory is my boss and he wanted to implement this before the audit while I was out of the office, so I needed to make sure he had a satisfactory response in a timely manner in case he had questions. Also, this is something that could improve plant efficiency so the benefits extend well outside our group and would look good in our employee files.Emails that I used were: Victory lunch played into my call with Pat, Team Focus was used for the Warranty Claim, the flow charts were used several times throughout the training.-----Original Message-----From: Assessment Administrator Sent: 4/5/2022 2:21 PM To: Pace, Jamie Cc: Subject : About your day (2 of 2) Following are some of the e-mails that you received today, along with some questions about how you approached them.

This new software sounds fantastic and we would love to be the test line. Anything that adds efficiency and cost reduction to our company will keep us moving forward. I do have a few questions and/or requests to your timeline. You mentioned below that the new software will allow our team members to make adjustments directly but they are very different than our current software. My question is, will we have some sort or operation manual or procedure in place to guide our employees while making these changes? We want to set them up for success and not waste time ""figuring it out.""While on the training subject,I see that we will role out this software before training everyone on it. I feel that the training needs to be done in the beginning to make this process work better. Do you plan on having someone onsite to train us?One more concern is the time it will take to cut the new software over. You mentioned it will take a full day to install but your timeline reflects 3 days (April 15th - 18th) to begin using it. What will be happening on the 16th and 17th? Will our line still be down? I will need to report this downtime to my managers and see if we need other groups to pick up our production. Looking forward to your replies and to get this new software loaded and online.

Are these items documented and have we involved HR in any of her performance issues? Have we discussed this in the past with Debbie? We, as leaders are charged with extracting max value out of our employees. For us to do this, we must understand the nature of their strengths and weaknesses and place them in the best situation to succeed. We can not hold Debbie accountable for her actions unless we've previously set clear expectations and documented shortcomings. Send me a list of documented infractions and I'll review. If necessary, we'll get HR involved. Until then, have a talk with Debbie and verify that there's no underlying problems that we're being insensitive to.Jamie,","Hi JJ,I think this is a valid concern. We should put folks in the best positions to transition into our plant seamlessly.

Please list the major categories of issues or problems facing Final Assembly in the Bridgeport facility of Soundproof Solutions.This company has serious trust issues. Most seem to be caused by lack of communication between departments, mostly from the top down. It appears as if each area operates in a silo with little to no regard to what happens in or to another area. 3. Describe why each entry in Question 2 is an issue or problem.Lack of communication creates a void between departments. If you do not understand the ""Why"" something is being implemented, or the ""Why"" behindthe effects of changes, or how changes effect another area then common problems can become large problems quickly.

To respond, simply click the Reply button above and enter your answers in the form of a reply e-mail. Turntable proposal: New turntable design for trim install - I elected to push this back until I could review it further. It seemed like it was a rush decision that wasn't properly vetted through the team. The fact that it was going to take months to build and install made pushing it back 2 weeks an easy decision. Victory lunch: Al and Paul will buy lunch for the group leader with better performance survey results - I addressed this by allowing the lunch to be scheduled by Cory while I was out. I elected to treat the JJ situation with a business as usual attitude until I could get the ethics questions answered by HR and Legal. Interaction you saw earlier today: Larry Hodges and Emily Carson disagree about SEQUENCE - I did not immediately address this once I saw that more training was coming on SEQUENCE in the near future, and II would have the opportunity to address this when JJ pulled Larry in to talk about professionalism. Debby Britzki: Request to move a team member with performance problems to another team - I didn't get to close the loop on this all the way, but before disciplining Debbie, I wanted to see what particular infractions she had committed and if our leaders had done any formal documenting of it. Additionally, I reached out to her former team leader to see if the issues were consistant and if they had any documented discipline on Debbie as well. Kirkland plant: Concern about team members transferring from an older plant - I felt this was a valid concern about putting people in the right position to succeed but made sure my teal leader knew that we weren't going to pick people for our group at the detriment of every other group but would approach it as ""who best fits where"" in order to make the entire organization better. Team focus: Data indicate higher error rates when the team lead cant support the group - I addressed this in calls with both Robin and Pat in an attempt to gain commitment. Upgrades to robot software: IT proposes software rollout plan - elected to allow this upgrade, but pushed the timeline back 4 days to remove it from the corporate audit window. Professional conduct: Salesperson unnerved by team member behavior during customer tour - I sent an email to the leader of this group, JJ, to address the concerns. I like the front line leaders to have an opportunity to address issues before proposing formal discipline. I agreed to sit in on the conversations if JJ preferred me to.  SEQUENCE talk: Workers grumbling over extra effort without extra pay under SEQUENCE Corporate audit: Request to prepare department for corporate review of operations - Sent email to team leaders to discuss with their folks in the couple days before the audit to reinforce professionalism, safety, and housekeeping initiatives. Suggestion box: Proposal for an incentive plan to increase team members suggestions - I used this several times to illustrate a point to Quinn and Pat. Warranty claim: Request for a plan to investigate warranty claims for a customers new units - I gave a plan that I thought was adequate to Cory for his investigation. Job rotation: Suggestion that team members rotate jobs to minimize boredom and errors - Pushed this back until after software upgrades and turntables were installed. Did this to see if numbers improved organically through installing these items, as job rotation may not be necessary if those programs were successful. Theft of company information: J.J. Paxton is suspected of stealing company-confidential information - Immediately informed HR of a potential ethics violation, however, did not address with JJ while HR conducts investigation. Will likelyterminate JJ in the future though.1. What were the three most important and the three least important e-mails to handle?Most - Theft, Warranty Claim, Meeting with QuinnLeast - Kirkland Plant, Victory Lunch,Turntable2.

Please list the major categories of issues or problems facing Final Assembly in the Bridgeport facility of Soundproof Solutions.Trust, Low Morale, Inconsistent approaches by team leads, poorcommunication3. Describe why each entry in Question 2 is an issue or problem.- Trust is the foundation for employeeengagement and without it people do not buy in to the purpose of what they aredoing. A leader must work to earn that trust by actively listening toemployee issues and acting upon them. - Morale is very important forproductivity. When people are in a positive environment, they work bettertogether and are more productive. - Inconsistencies from team leads.There must be alignment within leadership of the direction and expectations ofthe overall group. - Poor Communication - I would argue is justas detrimental to a workforce as trust.

Good job Alex and see you around.JoelFrom: Norman, AlexSent: 4/5/2022 8:06 AM To: Manning, Cory Cc: Subject : Professional Conduct Hi,You should know that salespeople assigned to our region occasionally use the Bridgeport plant to hold tours for potential customers. Its a good opportunity for the salespeople to show our advanced manufacturing techniques. Unfortunately, we ran into a problem last week when Velma Miller brought in representatives from a major potential account. As she led them past the Trim Install break area, she could overhear two team members making fun of SEQUENCE. They were having a good time making up silly things to be measured against, then taking turns disciplining each other for being very far off their goals. Velma thinks they were Larry Hodges and Harry Vitz.At another point in the tour, one of the guests, who was apparently quite attractive, mentioned to Velma how much she appreciated the opportunity to see our people work as they built the NoiseBreakers. Velma heard someone whistle and one of the team members say, You can watch me work anytime. It was probably Keith Baggus, as hes been known to make similar comments.Velma wasnt sure if any of the customers heard that, but she thought it was highly inappropriate and embarrassing. Id like to think that you will address this immediately. Velma told me that her next tour will be April 26 at 3:00 p.m., and she is very concerned that this issue be addressed by then. Please make sure that your team members understand how important it is to act professionally around customers. And this should also extend to keeping their work areas cleanVelma mentioned that there were some areas around Trim Install that were littered with bits of plastic and empty food wrappers.Thanks.AlexAlex NormanManager, Sales",NA,"Hi Shea,Nice to hear that you are planning to have Sequence Talk. Well, it is a good idea to keep our company at pace or surpass with the rapid change in technology.For the Final Assembly Team Members concern, it is a premature also to conclude that the company will not give credits to those performing well in the organization. I believe our company will give recognition to those deserving employees. I will give Al Howard heads up and we will address it properly. As you know, Al himself will provide food and refreshment on the talks. By the way, thanks for giving me the tip.Good luck for the talks, no comment on schedule.Would you mind sharing your good smile snap shots on your talks? I want to see your big smile on that occasion.Cory","Hello Jennifer,Thanks for the feedback.Yes, repairs will drag our sequence results.We do not want that to continue. Larry's absence really felt in the Line Production.Within the day, I will talk to Paul and have some inputs from Him. I will see to it that we are on the same page.After talking to Paul, I will call a meeting with the line key personnel and sure your input helps a lot to start with.In the meeting, the team will identify the root cause/s and formulate our road map of recovery and reduce repairs for the month of April and aim to fully recover the following month.Rest assured it will be addressed diligently.Joel",NA,"Good morning JJ,Please proceed on your plan to improve and place an order to our supplier.Take note on the delivery.Good job.Joel","Hello Isaac,Sure, can you visit me today. I am happy to listen your previous discussions with our Team.For me, improvement on our software is welcome, we have the same intention to improve productivity.However, we need to figure out that we can minimize production delays, as it is not easy to recover.I understand that by installing your new develop software, we can surpass our current targets and recover delays we incurred during installations.

Describe why each entry in Question 2 is an issue or problem.Joel's reply: a) Excellent Quality is the lifeblood of Company's product reputations, bad quality restricts the possibility of repeat orders. Good is not enough and a hindrance to pursuit of excellence. b) Nice working relationships among peers and management are essential for harmony in work. Being happy while working will unleash employees potential, of course increase in productivity. c) Target Quantity as minimum, will keep Company's financial forecast healthy. d) Improper termination or disciplinary actions of employee/s will also send negative signal to the entire organization. Let the employees feel they are important. Especially in our field in Engineering & Construction business wherein, talents of Engineers are the bread and butter. e) Comply previous company commitment will also give nice reputation to host community and among the industry. f) Firm decision, managers should advocate to make firm decision to solve issues and challenges. Managers should decide the best solution at that moment. It might be different later due to the availability of added information, but time can't wait.

Once I received the first note email I focused on reviewing and understanding the topics of the role play. After that I would rate the importance of each challenge and decide if it would need immediate attention or not.2. Communication, follow up by leadership, engagement of leaders or teams not being engaged, low morale, need for leadership training at the lead level3. Communication - during all 3 role plays each person I spoke with mentioned communication was lacking. Either by direct supervision or peer to peer groups.  Follow up by leadership - falls in line with communication. Making promises to follow up but not following through  Engagement - engagement starts with leaders, if they believe in the process then they will get their people involved. There was a lot of finger pointing or calling out others. Employees wanting to be engaged but shot down by leadership. Highly engaged teams leads to highly efficient and successful operations Leadership Training - seems that the leads were given positions because of tenure or expertise without knowing if they were qualified to lead a team. All three role plays had examples of needing some sort of leadership training to help them be more effective leaders within the company.-----Original Message-----From: Assessment Administrator Sent: 4/5/2022 2:20 PM To: Pace, Jamie Cc: Subject : About your day (1 of 2) This e-mail and the one that follows contain some final questions for you.

If team members don't know why they are being asked to change of if it is perceived that they are doing more for the same pay it can create resentment and not motivate to be a team playerIt is important that all subteams focus on working together. If defects are passed from one area to another it doesn't help the overall plant metric.I think the message that there are only so many places you can increase profitability when the competitionis beating you is not well understood by the floor workers.

Why did you feel that the e-mails you rated as most important were critical? Theft accusations and termination that day required immediate attention Anytime there are customer issues out in the field you have to get you arms around it quickly since you may producing items today with the same issue. It also has a negative impact on the customers perception of the product. Anytime you see internal infighting between the team you need to quickly respond to it, it may grow quickly and start impacting morale with other employees making a more difficult situation.3.Todays assessment provided you with background information about Soundproof Solutions and also presented thechallenging messages listed above. Were there situations where information from one source/challenge helped you to better understand and address anotherchallenge? If so, please list specific examples of theseinstances (Example: Message X related to Message Z, Company Policies related to Message Y, etc.). Yes, however I am not sure I used them well.as the day went on I found that I started reading information about individuals that could have played into my thinking. One that comes to mind i recommend to Cory who will lead the effort to prepare for the corporate audit. Then the victory lunch email showed that Pat was the strong leader of the group. so this validated my thinking. Knowing the theft accusation for JJ my have changed my mind on recommending him for any delegation items."

It is obvious from the graph, that customer satisfaction is High when we are quick in responding to their concerns/queries.But we also see the trend has changed in week 2 and should further understand the reason behind the same. Our customer satisfaction Index would go up, when we maintain our trend, hence should also understand below details:Reason for change in trend from Week 1 to Week 2What can be done to improve our response time to maintain consistencyI would also suggest to build onto this statistics for a longer period probably for 3 months to get more insights and chalk out corresponding action plan.We can discuss this further with Haley to get her view point.RegardsCaryFrom: Hurdle, TracySent: 4/5/2022 11:10 AMTo: Stevens, CaryCc: Subject: Customer satisfaction insightCary,I am taking a statistics class in the evenings after work. Our instructor directed us to find some real-world data so that we can see how statistics affect our lives. I retrieved some data on customer satisfaction off of our server and brought it home to study. The results were very interesting, and at my last class, my instructor was so pleased that he had me present my findings to the class! I thought you would be interested in the data, too, since they are from our team.I looked at a random set of 10 scheduling calls during the past two weeks and then compared them to the overall customer satisfaction scores for each call. When I plotted them, the result was surprising. I discovered that lower call time resulted in higher satisfaction scores for scheduling! Look at the attached graph and tell me if it doesnt amaze you, too. In Week 1, average call time is lower, and satisfaction is higher; in Week 2, its the reverse.I am going to share this information with Haley at next Wednesdays staff meeting. I think Haley will want to know about this so that we can integrate this approach into the way we manage. Unless you say otherwise, Ill send Haley the graph so she can see it before our meeting. Tomorrow morning I have called a meeting with the other Customer Support reps. At this meeting I will start pushing the other reps to handle their scheduling calls faster so we can start reaping the benefits right away.TracyTracey HurdleRepresentative, Customer ServicesSoundproof SolutionsAttachmentAttachment",NA,NA,NA,"Hi Alex,I am extremely sorry for what happened and assure you that I would take appropriate measures to ensure such incidents don't reoccur. I would personally reach out to the team and inform them to refrain from having any customer related discussions and such behavior would be considered as a professional misconduct and will be handled with utmost strictness.RegardsCaryFrom: Norman, AlexSent: 4/5/2022 11:25 AMTo: Stevens, CaryCc: Subject: Professional ConductCary,You should know that salespeople assigned to our region occasionally use the office in your area to hold meetings with potential customers. Its a good opportunity for the salespeople to show that the company has a local presence, and arent just dealing with all customers from some distant central office. Unfortunately, we ran into a problem last week when Velma Miller brought in representatives from a major potential account. As she led them past your teams break area, she could overhear several of your team members making fun of someone theyd visited on a scheduling call. Apparently, the customers accent was difficult to understand, and the two representatives were having a fine time re-enacting the visit. Velma couldnt see the representatives, but Velma thought it was highly inappropriate and embarrassing.Id like to think that you would address this incident immediately. Velma will be in town to hold additional meetings next week and is very concerned about being embarrassed by these two individuals. I am worried this is the work of Sloan and Eden. Please make sure they are under control so this doesnt happen again.Thanks.AlexAlex NormanManager, Central District SalesSoundproof Solutions",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Hi Taylor,I do understand this is an issue and needs to be addressed immediately . We do have a policy for replacements for retail customers and commercial customers but knowing the past experience with Mr Weedler, my suggestion is as below;I will arrange for my senior representative to have a chat with Mr Weedler to get an understanding on how the service has been so far and also get an insight on his expectations. Also, We will insist that we have received replacement request for 8 out of 9 orders and to maintain our customer satisfaction , we would request Mr Weedler to return the original purchase to get the same validated internally.We would assure him of replacement once the original purchase is returned and also put forth that this is being done to minimse the number of complaints and ensure utmost customer satisfaction.Please let me know if this sounds good. If required, we can discuss further on this and agree with Senior leadership as well.RegardsCaryFrom: Slade, TaylorSent: 4/5/2022 11:15 AMTo: Stevens, CaryCc: Subject: Weedler ContractingCary, Ashley Payne escalated this issue to me, and Id like your advice about it before I tell Mr. Weedler that we wont put up with his tricks anymore.Tom Weedler Contracting does custom renovations for homes in wealthy neighborhoods, and have been using our soundproofing exclusively. As a contractor, they do their own measurements and just order materials from usweve had fourteen orders from them in the past year.We just got a call from Weedler asking for a replacement roll of quietPAPER 70. They said that the colors in the pattern were slightly uneven and that the customer would complain. Company policy supports sending a replacement roll, so we processed the request with no questions asked. Ashley, who took the call, thought it sounded questionable because we havent heard anyone complain about the colors before. Ashley checked the records and found that Weedler has requested a replacement roll from eight of his past nine orders, each time for a different reason. Ive never known a contractor to have this many problems requiring a free roll. Weedler says his wealthy customers demand that everything is perfect. I say Weedler is ordering less quietPAPER than he needs, knowing that well give him an extra roll just for the asking. The worst part is, Weedlers the president of the local Home Contracting Association. Im sure hes telling all the other contractors to do the same thing.I think Weedler is deliberately cheating us, and we need to take a stand. I talked to Velma Miller in Sales, and found out that Weedler is planning to place another order for delivery next week. I dont see why we shouldnt just stop Weedler now, or at least make him pay for all of the rolls hes replaced in the past, but its your decision: just let me know.

UnooTSNDKaF,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Dear Tracy,I think its a great statistical data and I could actually analyze that now a days the attention span of people is pretty less compared to earlier days. People tend to be more busy in this competitive environment. So when we use the 30 secs rule to check on the satisfaction of the client instead of having longer stories to deal with unless otherwise the customer actually has issues and is unhappy with the service.Since the attention span is lower ,calls need to crisp and clean and to the point and that will help the client to respond accurately and we to understand our service better.We could also have a checklist/ questionnaire made for our customer reps depending on the solutions offered to the clients and also a generic one so its much more streamlined as a process to deal with. Please go ahead and share this with Haley and we will take it forward from there.Good job and I am really impressed with your eye for detail. We can certainly make it more better by articulating the process to make it simple and time sensitive and get more clients to participate in it and improve our score.RegardsCaryFrom: Hurdle, TracySent: 4/5/2022 11:10 AMTo: Stevens, CaryCc: Subject: Customer satisfaction insightCary,I am taking a statistics class in the evenings after work.

But i assure i will take care of this and address it in our team meeting.Secondly , i would request you to send me schedule of employees who would like to have a meeting in our area. This way we can streamline and book the meeting room so as to facilitate the employee and the client and they will not face any disturbances like the one that occurred recently.We can have much more professional approach if i am aware of the meeting rooms booked alongside the date and time and i can guide them accordingly.

Long story short , lets have a process in place to standardize our policy to our vendors. Sensing something fishy definitely here but we cant really prove anything if he is deliberately cheating on us or so.We cannot stop weedler because your never know which contractors is he related to and this might end up all our business. Hence we need to handle this very sensitively without letting him know that we have realized he is cheating on us and doing the same trick time and again.First lets try to have meeting with weedler and lets try and understand what the issue is.Second lets inform him that going forward we need to get the rolls back in terms of replacement so we can inform our team accordingly and take note of the faulty product. In the bargain we are not directly blaming him but we are trying to put forth our point that we if there is any discrepancy in our product please share it with us so as to not let it repeat in future.So we need to manage this very discreetly without him knowing about the same. But strategically try to speak to him and also make our point clear that if the colors don't match or if the product is faulty we will send a replacement only once we are able to check the product so that we don't repeat this issue in future. So here we cant shut his relationship with us and neither we can ask him to pay because of our policy. But give him subtle hints that he have realized what the reality is .Hope this helps.; Please fix a meeting and i shall help you take it forward from there.RegardsCaryFrom: Slade, TaylorSent: 4/5/2022 11:15 AMTo: Stevens, CaryCc: Subject: Weedler ContractingCary, Ashley Payne escalated this issue to me, and Id like your advice about it before I tell Mr. Weedler that we wont put up with his tricks anymore.Tom Weedler Contracting does custom renovations for homes in wealthy neighborhoods, and have been using our soundproofing exclusively.

I can feel the same in your enthusiastic e-mail and i don't want you to lose that enthusiasm, however, what happened is a very serious issue and the company has zero tolerance of breaching any code of conduct.Hence, make sure next time to never retrieve or share any data without upfront approval.NB: Once you share your findings with Haley, we will schedule a meeting the 3 of us to discuss what can be implemented to ameliorate the performance of the team.good job,Regards, From: Hurdle, TracySent: 4/5/2022 11:10 AMTo: Stevens, CaryCc: Subject: Customer satisfaction insightCary,I am taking a statistics class in the evenings after work.
